Motor Record R6-5 Release Notice
===============================================================================

The motor record software in this release is compatible with EPICS base
R3-14-10.


Contents
========
        
This <supporttop> contains the following motor record related items:
        - motor record and device driver database definitions.
        - the record level support library.
        - device/driver libraries for various controllers.
        - motor record/device/driver level documentation.
        - motor record release documentation.
        - two example applications; one without ASYN (i.e. motorExApp/NoMPF)
          and one with ASYN (i.e., motorExApp/WithMPF). See the README files
          under <motor>/iocBoot/* for configuration instructions.

As distributed, this support directory builds the following:
        - Record support and common code for all device/drivers; libmotor.a.
        - All non-asyn dependent device drivers; liboms.a, libsoftMotor.a,
          libDeltaTau.a.
        - If ASYN is defined, all other device drivers are built.

Any of the following device/driver libraries can be omitted from the build by
commenting out the appropriate line in ./motorApp/Makefile.
        Acs - Advanced Control Systems controllers; AcsSrc directory.
        DeltaTau - Delta Tau controllers; DeltaTauSrc directory.
        Ims - Intelligent Motion Systems (IMS) controllers; ImsSrc directory.
        Mclennan - Mclennan controllers; MclennanSrc directory.
        Micos - Micos controller; MicosSrc directory.
        MicroMo - MicroMo controllers; MicroMoSrc directory.
        Newport - Newport controllers; NewportSrc directory.
        oms - Oregon Micro System (OMS) controllers; OmsSrc directory.
        PI - Physik Instrumente (PI) GmbH & Co. controllers; PiSrc
                directory.
        softMotor - Soft Channel device support; SoftMotorSrc directory.


Configuration
=============
The following files can be edited to tailor this distribution to site specific
needs.  See individual files for instructions.
        - <motor>/configure/RELEASE: Define location of external products.

                If only VMEbus based motor controllers (e.g., OMS, Highland
                V544) and/or Soft Channel device support is used, then only
                EPICS_BASE is required.

                For serial and/or GPIB motor controller communication, ALL of
                the following support modules are required;
                        - EPICS base R3-14-7
                        - ASYN R4-2

                If any example applications (motorExApp) are to be built, then
                        TEMPLATE_TOP and MSITOP must be defined.

        - <motor>/motorApp/Makefile: Defines which device/driver modules to
          build.
        - ./Makefile: uncomment the following to build example applications.
                #DIRS := $(DIRS) $(filter-out $(DIRS), motorExApp)
                #DIRS := $(DIRS) $(filter-out $(DIRS), iocBoot)
        - ./motorExApp/Makefile: Define which, if any, example applications are
                to be built.



Known Problems
==============

1) The PAUSE function of the SPMG field only works if the RTRY field is
        nonzero.  This bug existed as far back as V3.3 of the motor record.

2) MM4005 only.  On the first attempt to move off an activated limit switch,
        the motor moves to where it was commanded.  However, the motor record's
        positions (both target and readback) do not reflect the move.  This
        is because of the following sequence of events:

        - a limit (i.e., laser light beam) violation occurs.  The Newport
        controller turns motor power off.
        - the axis stops at position X.
        - a move command is issued in the opposite direction.
        - after a delay of between 16.67 ms and 33.33 ms, a motor status
        (i.e., MS) query is issued to the MM4005.
        - the motor status response indicates the axis is NOT in motion
        and motor power is OFF (the motor record interprets this as "Done
        Moving" true).
        - a "read actual positions" command is issued.
        - the actual position response indicates the axis is still at
        position X.
        - the controller turns motor power on and the axis moves to the
        requested position.

3) The OMS VME58 servo motor controller board (i.e., model -8S) is unable to
        move off an activated limit switch.  Users are advised to avoid this
        situation.  This problem is fixed with the MAXv model.

4) With R5-3 of the motorRecord, negative encoder resolutions (ERES) are
        supported.  This allows the user to change the sign of ERES rather than
        reverse encoder wires when the motor and encoder direction are
        reversed.

        There is a peculiarity with the OMS controller boards when they are
        configured with MRES and ERES of opposite polarity.  Since both the
        commanded and feedback positions are set with the same command (LP),
        the user must enter the opposite polarity when setting the OMS motor
        controllers position.

        For example, if MRES is positive and ERES is negative and the user
        wants to set the current position to 10.00 inches, then -10.00 must be
        entered in the VAL or DVAL field.

5) There are several known problems with the status update field (STUP);
        - the motor record gets stuck in the moving state (i.e., DMOV=0) if
          a STUP request occurs at the same time as device support reports
          motion complete (i.e., RA_DONE bit in MSTA field).
        - a STUP request during a jog results in the motor stopping, then
          resuming the jog.
        - if the motor record's SCAN field is set to periodic scan, the
          record's status is periodically updated unless the motor is moving.
          In other words, the status update is skipped when DMOV=0 and record
          is processed from a periodic scan.

6) The MM4000 sets its' "Axis in Motion" status bit (MS command) false before
        the target position (as read by the TP command) is reached.  This can
        appear to the motor record as a following error causing a needless
        retry if retries are enabled.


Modification Log from R6-4 to R6-5
==================================

1) Fixed 64 bit compile problems with PI E816 and Aerotech Ensemble.

        Files modified: devPIE816.cc and devEnsemble.cc

2) Dirk Zimoch (PSI) fixed a bug in the OMS MAXv driver that caused the 
        set_status() function to overwrite the home switch status in the
        response string.

        File modified: drvMAXv.cc

3) Matthew Pearson (Diamond) fixed a bug on Newport XPS and MM4000 asyn motor
        port drives that was causing idle polling to interfere with setting
        positions and prevented auto save/restore from working.

        Files modified: drvMM4000Asyn.c, drvXPSAsyn.c, drvMotorSim.c and
                        drvANC150Asyn.cc; added epicsMutex[Lock/Unlock] to
                        motorAxisSetDouble().

4) A problem was introduced in R6-4 (fixed in R6-4-2) of the old motor record
        device drive architecture.  If during the move of one or motors the
        motor task did not issue an OS delay during status updates, it could
        potentially not respond to any further motor commands.
          
        Files modified: - MotorSrc/motordrvCom.cc; always check for incoming
                                                   messages.
                        - OmsSrc/drvOms58.cc; reduced start_status() delays.

5) Modifications were made to motorRecord.cc:do_work() with R6-4 to limit the
        ramifications of ORing MIP_MOVE with MIP_RETRY.  Unfortunately, the
        effect of one of those changes prevented the motor from doing its'
        backlash move when a motor move was interrupted by "New Target
        Monitoring".  The user would see a "tdir" message in the iocsh and
        the motor would move, not to the target position, but to the target
        minus the backlash distance.

        File modified: do_work() in motorRecord.cc; unconditionally set the
                       postprocess indicator TRUE so postProcess() can do the
                       backlash move.

6) Prevent multiple STOP commands.

        File modified: motorRecord.cc:process(); added check for !MIP_STOP to
                       NTM logic.

7) The asynMotor device support would erroneously leave a motor-in-motion
        indicator on if the motor record issued a LOAD_POS command before the
        2nd pass of device support initialization.  Added logic to
        devMotorAsyn.c:asynCallback() to prevent moveRequestPending from being
        left in a nonzero state after the execution of a LOAD_POS command done
        as a result of save/restore during boot-up.

        File modified:  devMotorAsyn.c:asynCallback()

8) Aerotech Ensemble device driver fixes for incorrect Jog speeds, support for
        a negative PosScaleFactor parameter and detecting maximum travel limit
        switch faults.
        
        Files modified: devEnsemble.cc, drvEnsemble.h, drvEnsemble.cc

9) Moved preprocessor assertions in motor.h to the end of the conditional logic
        to avoid MSVC compiler errors.
   
        File modified: MotorSrc/motor.h

10) Matthew Pearson's (Diamond) fix for the motor simulator getting stuck in
        the Moving state after multiple LOAD_POS commands to the same position.
        
        File modified: MotorSrc/devMotorAsyn.c; set needUpdate = 1 in
                       asynCallback() before dbProcess() call.

11) A consequence of the fix for item #10 above caused the motor record to see
        RA_DONE in the MSTA field True on the 1st status update after a move;
        whether or not the motor was done moving.  Matthew Pearson's fix is to
        set motorAxisDone False in motorAxisDrvSET_t functions that start
        motion (motorAxisHome, motorAxisMove, motorAxisVelocityMove) and force
        a status update with a motorParam->callCallback(pAxis->params) call.
        
        Files modified: - NewportSrc/drvMM4000Asyn.c
                        - AtttoCube/drvANC150.cc
                        - MotorSimSrc/drvMotorSim.c

12) Removed the OMSL field from the motorx_all.adl medm display to prevent
        confusion with motor position closed-loop control.
        
        File modified: motorApp/op/adl/motorx_all.adl

13) An error was introduced with R5-3 when the STUP field was added (item #4
        under R5-3) that resulted in the PACT field being cleared before
        recGblGetTimeStamp(), alarm_sub() and monitor() were called.

        File modified: process() in motorRecord.cc

14) Made OMS device driver Setup and Configure shell command error messages
        more prominent.
        
        Files modified: <driver>Setup() drvMAXv.cc, drvOms58.cc and drvOms.cc

15) OMS MAXv driver changes from Austen Rose (Diamond) that support backwards
        compatibility with ver:1.29 and earlier MAXv firmware. OMS changed
        their line terminator from '<LF><NULL>' to '<LF>' for RA, QA, EA and
        RL command with ver:1.30 firmware.
        
        File modified: recv_mess() in OmsSrc/drvMAXv.cc

16) Bug fixes for Newport PM500 driver not initializing the MSTA field
        correctly.  Added support for CNEN field.
        
        Files modified: devPM500.cc, drvPM500.cc, motorRecord.dbd

17) Mark Rivers made numerous changes to elminate 64-bit compiler warning
        messages.

18) Applied item #11 above to the Newport XPS driver.
        File modified: NewportSrc/drvXPSAsyn.c



Modification Log from R6-3 to R6-4
==================================

1) The motor record was not posting raw actual velocity changes (RVEL field).

        File modified: motor_update_values() in motordevCom.cc


2) A problem with OMS VME58 2.24-8S version firmware and all 2.35 firmware
        versions has arisen since the modifications described in item #8 under
        R6-3 were made.  When the user sets the motor record's position, the
        previous target and readback positions are read from the controller on
        the next update.  This occurs with the previous release (R6-3) because
        the "stale data delay" was changed to zero for the drvOms58 driver.
        
        With this release the driver searches all VME58 board ID's for either
        2.24-8S or any 2.35 version.  If any board is found, the "stale data
        delay" is set to a non-zero value.
        
        This problem is similar to the "intermittent wrong LS status" problem,
        but in this case it is the Load Position (LOAD_POS) motor command that
        results in "stale data" being read by the driver.  After extensive
        testing, I am unable to re-create the original "intermittent wrong LS
        status" problem.

        File modified: motor_init() in motorApp/OmsSrc/drvOms58.cc. Added
                       ID search; if found, set "update_delay" non-zero.

3) A problem was reported by Emma Shepherd (Diamond) with the previous release
        if the "Use RDBL Link" field (URIP) was set to "Yes".  The NTM logic
        was sending stop commands and issuing the "tdir=.." message to the
        console if the RDBL link was used.  This error was the result of
        changing the NTM logic as described in item #11 under R6-3
        modifications.

        With this release, the NTM logic is restored to using feedback rather
        than reference positions.  In addition, an "NTM deadband factor" field
        (NTMF) is added to allow the user to set the NTM deadband;
                 NTM deadband = NTMF * (|BDST| + RDBD)
        NTMF must be >= 2. If properly configured, the NTM deadband prevents
        NTM logic from issuing a STOP command at the end of a DC motor move
        that overshoots its' target position.
        
        Files modified: - MotorSrc/motorRecord.dbd; NTMF added.
                        - MotorSrc/motorRecord.cc; NTM logic uses deadband
                          based on NTMF.

4) Changed the "update delay" for OMS MAXv's from 10ms to zero.

        File modified: - motorApp/OmsSrc/drvMAXv.cc; set "update_delay" member
                         of "targs" to zero.

5) Major changes have been made to the Access Security Level (ASL) attribute
        of the motor record fields. With previous releases, the following
        fields were set to ASL=0; FOF, VOF, SSET, SUSE, VBAS, VMAX, SBAS, SMAX,
        UREV and MRES.  All other fields were set to ASL=1 by default.

        With this release, the policy is to set all the fields that the user
        requires to do the following to ASL = 0;
        - move a motor; (VAL, DVAL, RVAL, TWF, TWR, TWV, RLV, JOGF, JOGR)
        - stop a motor; (STOP, SPMG)
        - enable/disable motor torque; (CNEN)
        - set the position of a motor; (SSET, SUSE, SET)
        - set the "user" offset of a motor; (FOF, VOF, FOFF,OFF)
        - update the status of a motor; (STUP)
        - adjust or turn off backlash; (BDST)

        All other fields are set to ASL = 1.
        
        This means that out of the list of fields that were previously set to
        ASL=0; VBAS, VMAX, SBAS, SMAX, UREV and MRES are now set to ASL=1. 
        
        File modified: - MotorSrc/motorRecord.dbd

6) Previous releases of the motor record distribution would not compile for
        64-bit platforms.  Numerous minor modifications were made for this
        release to attain 64-bit compatibility.  Note that at the time of
        writing (03/14/08), this release was successfully compiled on a
        Linux Fedora Core 6 x86_64 host using gcc version 4.1.2, but there
        are bugs.  Since EPICS base (R3.14.9) has not had all the bugs wrung
        out (Mantis ID's #309, #310), there are no immediate plans to debug
        64-bit related problems.
        
        Files modified: - too numerous to mention.
        

7) Fixed a bug that was setting the Dial Readback Value (DRBV) based on RRBV
        when URIP = Yes.  See "Getting Started with EPICS"/"Motor Record"/
        "Feedback data flow" diagram for details.
        
        File modified: process_motor_info() in motorRecord.cc

8) Added support to the asyn motor device driver architecture for the MR
        GET_INFO command.
        
        Modifications in <motor>/motorApp/MotorSrc:
        - added a new paramLib function member (forceCallback) to paramSupport
          in paramLib.h
        - added new parameter (forceCallback) to paramList and a new function
          (paramForceCallback) in paramLib.c.  paramForceCallback()'s only
          function is to set "forceCallback" so that the MR gets processed.
        - added a new motorAxisDrvSET_t member (forceCallback) to
          motor_interface.h.
        - added a new asyn motorCommand (motorUpStatus) in drvMotorAsyn.h
        - changed the GET_INFO case in devMotorAsyn.c build_trans() to use
          the int32Type interface and the motorUpStatus command.
        - added a motorUpStatus case to the command switch in devMotorAsyn.c
          asynCallback().
        - added a motorUpStatus case to the command switch in writeInt32() of
          drvMotorAsyn.c which calls the driver's forceCallback().
          
        Modifications to <motor>/motorApp/NewportSrc/drvMM4000Asyn.c:
        - added motorAxisforceCallback() to motorMM4000's motorAxisDrvSET_t.
        - implemented the motorAxisPosition command in motorAxisSetDouble().
        - added motorAxisforceCallback() which calls forceCallback() to set the
          forceCallback parameter and then signals the poller task.

9) The OMS MAXv handles execution of queued acceleration commands differently
        than earlier controllers.  In the case where the slew acceleration
        (ACCL field) had been overridden by an acceleration command primitive in
        the Pre-move field (PREM), this resulted in the inability to restore
        the slew acceleration when a stop command was issued.

        With this release, the common OMS device support (devOmsCom.cc) checks
        the controller ID (ident) for a MAXv when a STOP command is issued and
        if a MAXv is found, extra controller commands are added to force the
        restoration of the slew acceleration.

        File modified: OmsSrc/devOmsCom.cc

10) Previous releases had a problem with the OMS MAXv device driver when it was
        configured for more than one board, and, either A24 or A32 addressing
        was specified. The driver was not sizing the address space occupied by
        each MAXv correctly.
        
        Files modified: OmsSrc/drvMAXv.[cc/h]

11) Fixed OMS MAXv error on ER command.  Replaced UU1.0 command with UF.

        File modified: OmsSrc/devOmsCom.cc

12) Fixed OMS MAXv bug with incorrect scaling of PID parameters reported by
        Jerome Hosselet (CNRS).
        
        File modified: OmsSrc/devOmsCom.cc

13) motorUtilAux.cc was not declaring pdbbase correctly.  Consequently, link
        errors were occuring with Visual C++.
        
        File modified: MotorSrc/motorUtilAux.cc

14) With previous releases, motor_task() would not allow the next polling
        update to take place without some delay, even if the last update had
        taken longer than the total time required for the polling rate delay.
        With this release the motor_task() skips the delay if either the time
        elapsed since last update is > polling rate delay or if the wait time
        is < 1/2 the epicsThreadSleepQuantum.

        File modified: MotorSrc/motordrvCom.cc

15) The declaration for scanOnce was changed from (void * precord) to
        (struct dbCommon *) with EPICS base R3.14.10, causing a compile error
        in motorRecord.cc.

        File modified: MotorSrc/motorRecord.cc


16) System generation files (Makefiles and "configure" files) have been updated
        based on the makeBaseApp utility.  In addition, this release supports
        the parallel make feature available starting with R3.14.10.
        
        Files modified: - all "configure" files.
                        - the "top" and "motorApp" Makefiles.

17) Ron Sluiter added asyn motor support for the attocube systems AG ANC150
        Piezo Step Controller.

        Files modified: added the "AttocubeSrc" directory

18) Chad Weimer (Aerotech) added support for Aerotech's Ensemble family of
        digital servo controllers.

        Files modified: added the "AerotechSrc" directory

19) John Hammonds added support of the Physik Instrumente (PI) GmbH & Co. E-816
        motor controller.
  
        Files modified: added devPIE816.cc, drvPIE816 and drvPIE816.h to the
                        PiSrc directory

20) Added a field (RMOD) that allows the user to select different ways of
        calculating the retry distance move.  The default mode (Unity) moves
        the motor a relative distance based on the dial error (DIFF field).
        Badly behaved devices (piezo motors) can oscillate around their target
        position in this mode.  Hence, two other modes were added to allow a
        decreasing response from the motor record after each retry.

        The Arithmetic mode generates an arithmetic sequence of corrections.
        For example, if the max. retry count (RTRY) is 10, then the retries
        will proceed as follows; DIFF * (1.0), DIFF * (9/10), DIFF * (8/10),
        etc.
        
        The Geometric mode generates a geometric sequence with a 1/2 common
        factor of corrections.  For example, if the max. retry count is 10,
        then the retries will proceed as follows; DIFF * (1.0), DIFF * (1/2)
        DIFF * (1/4), DIFF * (1/8), etc.

        Files modified: - added the "RMOD" to MotorSrc/motorRecord.dbd
                        - RMOD support changes to MotorSrc/motorRecord.cc


Modification Log from R6-2 to R6-3
==================================

1)  <motor>/motorApp/NewportSrc was not building for the solaris-sparc-gnu
        target.  Three changes were made to test the above change for the
        solaris-sparc (SUNWspro) target and to make the motor record
        distribution solaris-sparc (SUNWspro) compatible.
        
        Files modified: - "XPSGatheringMain_SYS_LIBS_solaris += socket nsl"
                          added to motorApp/NewportSrc/Makefile.
                        - "motorSimSupport_LIBS += motor" added to
                          motorApp/MotorSimSrc/Makefile.
                        - modified "Debug" statement arguments in
                          motorApp/NewFocusSrc/drvPMNC87xx.cc
                        - "oms_LIBS += asyn" added to motorApp/OmsSrc/Makefile.

2) Mark Rivers found and fixed a bug in the motor record; RDBD was being used
        in motordevCom.cc's motor_init_record_com() before the RDBD validation
        check in motorRecord.cc's init_record().  This resulted in motor
        positions not being initialized from save/restore at boot-up if RDBD
        was not included in a save/restore save set.

        File modified: the enforceMinRetryDeadband() call in init_record() was
                       moved to before the call to device support init_record.

3) Added Shifu Xu's support for Animatics Corporation SmartMotor.

        Directory added: motorApp/SmartMotorSrc

4) A bug was introduced into the shell command "motorUtilInit()" affecting
        these versions of the motor distribution; R6-2, R6-2-1 and R6-2-2. This
        bug resulted in the erroneous error message; "motorUtilInit: Prefix
        %c: has more than 53 characters. Exiting".

        File modified: motorApp/MotorSrc/motorUtil.cc

5) The "alldone" PV in motorUtil.db defaulted to the "moving" state between
        "iocInit" and "motorUtilInit", giving the false indication that motors
        were moving during boot-up.  The "alldone" PV now defaults to the
        "done" state.

        File modified: motorApp/Db/motorUtil.db

6)  Added Jens Eden's (BESSY) modifications to the OMS MAXv driver.
        - register iocsh commands.
        - added USE_DEVLIB with RTEMS conditional.
        - replaced errlogPrintf calls in ISR with epicsInterruptContextMessage
          calls.

        File modified: motorApp/OmsSrc/drvMAXv.cc

7) OMS MAXv driver clean-up; made send_mess() and recv_mess() non-global and
        removed unneeded stub start_status().

        File modified: motorApp/OmsSrc/drvMAXv.cc

8) The OMS VME58 "stale data" problem referred to in item #4 under R5-7 was
        caused by communicating via the ASCII commands while the DPRAM was
        updating.  With this release the OMS VME58 driver's "stale data delay"
        is set to zero.  In addition, a "Work around for intermittent wrong LS
        status" that occurred only with version 2.35 firmware is removed.
        Finally, start_status() is modified to wait for DPRAM update before
        exiting.
        
        File modified: motorApp/OmsSrc/drvOms58.cc

9) Raised the precedence of INIT string in motor_init_record_com() for
        controllers (PI C-848) that require an INIT string primitive before a
        LOAD_POS can be executed.
        
        File modified: motorApp/MotorSrc/motordevCom.cc

10) Numerous fixes for the PI C-848 controller.

        Files modified: motorApp/PiSrc/[drvPIC848.h,devPIC848.cc,drvPIC848.cc]

11) Two changes were made to the motor record to better support DC motors.

        First, with this release, if retries are disabled (RTRY=0), then all
        moves are done in absolute mode.  This allows a DC motor user to have
        the readback values calculated based on either the local encoder (UEIP)
        or the readback link (URIP), but still have all moves commanded in
        absolute mode.  Previous releases the of the motor record would use
        relative moves if either the local or external readbacks were enabled,
        regardless of the state (enable/disable) of the retries.
        
        Second, the New Target Monitoring (NTM field) logic is changed to use
        reference rather than feedback positions. This eliminates unwanted motor
        record STOP commands at the end of DC motor moves.

        File modified: motorApp/MotorSrc/motorRecord.cc

12) Motor record bug fix for long moves at backlash velocity after a new target
        position detected (tdir change).

        File modified: motorApp/MotorSrc/motorRecord.cc

13) Ron Sluiter added support for the Kohzu SC-800 stepper motor controller.

        Directory added: motorApp/KohzuSrc

14) Joe Sullivan added support for the piezosystem jena GmbH EDS controller.

        Directory added: motorApp/PiJenaSrc

15) The examples iocNoMPF and iocWithMPF were renamed iocNoAsyn and
        iocWithAsyn, respectively.  

        Directories renamed in <motor>/motorExApp and <motor>/iocBoot.


Modification Log from R6-1 to R6-2
==================================

1) Bug fix for Newport PM500 initialization problem.  The PM500 driver was not
        issuing the correct command when it queried for the number of axes at
        boot up; correct command (XSTAT?), incorrect command (STAT?).  This
        resulted in a "PM500 system error" message on the 1st axis.

        File modified: NewportSrc/drvPM500.cc

2) A bug was introduced with R6-0.  The OMS device support was overwriting PID
        parameter fields during normalization calculation.

        File modified: OmsSrc/devOmsCom.cc

3) Bug fix in motor_init_record_com() for logic that determines precedence
        between controller or save/restore motor position at boot-up.  Negative
        controller positions were not handled correctly.

        File modified: MotorSrc/motordevCom.cc; take absolute value of position
                       from controller.

4) Added Pete Jemian's motorxU.adl and modifications to the motor.db template
        that provides the user with the ability to adjust the motor tweak (TWV)
        and slew velocity (VELO/S) values by a factor of either 0.1 or 10.

        File added: motorApp/op/adl/motorxU.adl
        Files modified: - motorApp/Db/motor.db; scalcout records $(P)$(M)_vCh
                                                      and $(P)$(M)_twCh added.
                        - motorApp/op/adl/topMotors[4/8].adl; added motorxU.adl
                          to menu selection.

5) Clear home request when soft-limit violation occurs.

        File modified: do_work() in motorRecord.cc


6) Joe Sullivan added support for Thorlabs Piezo Control Module, model MDT695.

        Directory added: motorApp/ThorLabsSrc

7) Due to releasing R6-1 during Newport development, R6-1 can result in linker
        errors on the symbol "xpsgathering".  Newport users should upgrade to
        R6-2.


Modification Log from R6-0 to R6-1
==================================

1) MicroMo model MVP 2001 B02 driver; bug fix for recv_mess() always returning
        nread = 0.

        File modified: MicroMoSrc/drvMVP2001.cc

2) New Focus models 8750 and 8752; check for special STA cmnd handling.
        SocketClose() at exit added but disabled pending further testing.

        File modified: NewFocusSrc/drvPMNC87xx.cc

3) Physik Instrumente (PI) GmbH & Co. C-862; added 17ms "status update delay"
        to prevent dropped communication characters in controller; i.e.
        erroneous command error responses.

        File modified: PiSrc/drvPIC862.cc

4) All motorStatus[xx].adl displays modified to show motor position with text
        rather than with bar graphs.

        Files modified: motorApp/op/adl/motorStatus[xx].adl

5) Joe Sullivan added support for the Physik Instrumente (PI) GmbH & Co. model
        E-710 motor controller.

        Files added to motorApp/PiSrc: devPIE710.cc, drvPIE710.cc, drvPIE710.h

6) Parker 6K Series; closeSocket() call at EXIT code added (requires asd8 BSP).

        File modified: drvPC6K.cc


Modification Log from R5-9 to R6-0
==================================

1) The OMS MAXv polling rate, which set is from the MAXvSetup() st.cmd command,
        is allowed to be as high as the OS clock rate; i.e.,
        (1/epicsThreadSleepQuantum()).

        File modified: drvMAXv.cc - changed polling rate error check to,
                       1 <= polling rate <=  (1/epicsThreadSleepQuantum())

2) Since R4-5 (item #9), RDBD must be >= MRES.  The test for this condition
        was done using floating point values.  This caused an occasional
        error that resulted in the record not always issuing a motor move
        command when RDBD = MRES and the user issued incremental move request
        equal to MRES.

        File modified: do_work() in motorRecord.cc - changed test from float
                       to integer math.

3) A warning message was added with R5-6 when a user attempted to move an OMS
        motor with an invalid velocity (slew <= base).  Applications that
        manipulate the velocity values are unaware of this restriction and
        create a torrent of these messages.  With this release the OMS device
        will only output this warning message once.

        File modified: Added message latch to oms_build_trans() in devOmsCom.cc

4) Added a work around for OMS PC68/78 firmware error.  PC68/78 controllers
        make an erroneous response after they are queried with the "?KP"
        command at boot-up.  This resulted in 1st axis having same position (RP
        command) as last the axis.

        File modified: Added a dummy comm. transaction to motor_init() in
                       drvOmsPC68.cc.

5) GPIB under ASYN allows only one input EOS character; no output EOS is
        allowed. Adjustments were made to the Newport ESP300 driver to
        accomodate this restriction.

        File modified: Changed EOS from "\r\n" to "\n" in motor_init(). Process
                       the \r in recv_mess().

6) Mohan Ramanathan and Ron Sluiter added support for the Physik Instrumente
        (PI) GmbH & Co. Model C-862 motor controller.

        Files added: Added devPIC862.cc, drvPIC862.cc, PIC862Register.cc and
                    drvPIC862.h to the motorApp/PiSrc directory.

7) Joe Sullivan added support for the ACS Tech80 SPiiPlus motor controller.

        Files added: Added motorApp/AcsTech80Src directory.

8) Joe Sullivan added support for the Spectra-Physics Encoder Mike Controller
        (Model: 18011).

        Files added: Added motorApp/OrielSrc directory.

9) The New Focus Model 8750 Network Controller device support ("PMNC8750") has been
        changed "PMNC87xx".  It now supports both the 8750 and 8752 models.

        Files modified - All of motorApp/NewFocusSrc.


Modification Log from R5-8 to R5-9
==================================

1) The motor record was ignoring the retry deadband (RDBD) when a new target
        position was entered and the move was in the "preferred direction";
        even when backlash correction was disabled (i.e., BDST == 0).

        File modified: do_work() in motorRecord.cc

2) Added Kevin Peterson's (UNI-CAT) motorUtil task to the motor record
        distribution.  The motorUtil task monitors and maintains 3 PV's;
        $(P)alldone, $(P)allstop, $(P)moving.  motorUtil is a replacement for
        the all_com_##.db distributed with the STD support module.  See the
        motorUtil.db file for details.

        Files added: to <motor>/motorApp/MotorSrc - motorUtil.cc
                                                  - motorUtilAux.cc
                     to <motor>/motorApp/Db       - motorUtil.db
        Files modified: - <motor>/motorApp/MotorSrc/Makefile
                        - <motor>/motorApp/MotorSrc/motorSupport.dbd
                        - updated examples with motorUtil.

3) Bug fix for the status update field (STUP) not being processed under certain
        circumstances; e.g., LVIO true, SPMG set to PAUSE, etc..
        
        File modified: motorRecord.cc - moved STUP processing to top of
                                        do_work().

4) Peter Denison (Diamond Light Source) enhanced the Soft Channel device
        support by eliminating the 50 soft motor limit (MAXMSGS) and replacing
        it with an unlimited linked list.

        Files modified: - <motor>/motorApp/SoftMotorSrc/devSoft.h
                        - <motor>/motorApp/SoftMotorSrc/devSoftAux.cc

5) Peter Denison (Diamond), Nick Rees (Diamond) and Mark Rivers (APS) have
        added a new motor record device support architecture based on ASYN;
        called "asyn motor" support.  The asyn motor support "is an attempt to
        define a clean, extensible API for motor controller drivers to
        support".  This is a preliminary release of work in progress.  Do not
        use "asynMotor" device support at this time, except for development and
        testing purposes only.
        
        Directory added - MotorSimSrc; motor simulation software.
        Files added     - <motor>/motorApp/MotorSrc/devMotorAsyn.c
                        - <motor>/motorApp/MotorSrc/drvMotorAsyn.c

        Files modified  - <motor>/motorApp/MotorSrc/motorSupport.dbd

6) Joe Sullivan added support for the New Focus Model 8750 Network Controller.

        Directory added - NewFocusSrc.

7) Joe Sullivan added support for the Physik Instrumente (PI) GmbH & Co. Model
        E-662 piezo controller.

        Files added     - <motor>/motorApp/PiSrc/PIC662Register.cc
                        - <motor>/motorApp/PiSrc/devPIC662.cc

                        - <motor>/motorApp/PiSrc/drvPIC662.h                    

8) Mark Rivers added asyn motor support for the Newport XPS-C8 motor
        controller.  This is a preliminary release of work in progress.
        However, it has fewer problems than the previous XPS support, so we
        recommend using the new asyn support for the XPS, with the
        understanding that it is still under development.

        Files added     - <motor>/motorApp/NewportSrc/XPS_C8_drivers.cpp
                        - <motor>/motorApp/NewportSrc/XPS_C8_drivers.h

                        - <motor>/motorApp/NewportSrc/drvXPSAsyn.c

9) Mark Rivers added the Trajectory Scanning software for both the Newport
        MM4005 and XPS-C8 motor controllers to the motor record distribution.
        
        Files added     - <motor>/motorApp/NewportSrc/MM4005_trajectoryScan.st
                        - <motor>/motorApp/NewportSrc/XPS_trajectoryScan.st

                        - <motor>/motorApp/Db/XPS_trajectoryScan.db

10) Brian Tieman and Ron Sluiter added support for the standalone, RS-232
        versions of the OMS PC68 and PC78 model controllers.  The same device
        (OMS PC68/78) and driver (drvOmsPC68) support both models.

        Files added     - <motor>/motorApp/OmsSrc/devOmsPC68.cc
                        - <motor>/motorApp/OmsSrc/drvOmsPC68.cc

        Files modified  - <motor>/motorApp/OmsSrc/devOms.dd


Modification Log from R5-7 to R5-8
==================================

1) Mark Rivers added support for the Faulhaber MCDC2805 servo controller.

        Files added: the <motor>/motorApp/FaulhaberSrc directory and it's
                        contents were added.

2) Mark Rivers added support for building the motor record distribution from
        a win32-x86 host; i.e., MS Visual C++ compiler.  Since the strtok_r()
        function does not exist on Windows, all calls to strtok_r() have been
        replaced with calls to epicsStrtok_r(). Numerous files were modified
        by adding the "epicsShareFunc" declaration to global functions. The
        epicsStrtok_r() appears in EPICS base beginning with R3.14.8.  Hence,
        the Mclennan and Newport porting of the motor record distribution are
        dependent on R3.14.8 and above.

        Files added:    - RELEASE.win32-x86 in <motor>/configure.
                        - st.cmd.win32 in <motor>/iocBoot/iocWithMPF.
        Files modified: for epicsStrtok_r();
                        - <motor>/motorApp/MclennanSrc/drvPM304.cc
                        - <motor>/motorApp/NewportSrc/drvMM3000.cc
                        - <motor>/motorApp/NewportSrc/drvMM4000.cc

3) Joe Sullivan added support for Parker Hannifin, Compumotor Division, 6K
        Series controllers.

        Files added: the <motor>/motorApp/PC6KSrc directory and it's
                        contents were added.

4) Malcolm Walters (Diamond) contributed bug fixes to motorRecord.cc for;
        - get_units() returned wrong units for VMAX.
        - get_graphic_double() and get_control_double() returned incorrect
          values for VELO.

5) <motor>/motorApp/Makefile was modified to build everything by default.
        This makes integration into synApps easier.  Users can comment out
        particular directories if they do not want them built.

        File modified: <motor>/motorApp/Makefile



Modification Log from R5-6 to R5-7
==================================

1) ASYN R4-3 compatibility change to nbytesTransfered argument of
        pasynOctetSyncIO read and write members.

        Files modified: All drivers using ASYN.

2) IMS MDrive bug fix for not setting acceleration = deceleration correctly.

        File modified: devMDrive.c

3) Bug fix for homing and jog request not cleared after a limit switch error.

        File modified: motorRecord.cc - Added clear_buttons() function.
                                      - db_post_events home and jog buttons.

4) A delay was added to the driver support with R3-5 to prevent motor
        controller status updates from reading "stale data".  This problem
        arose under the following scenario;
        - Start a motor move which is in the opposite direction from the
        previous move.
        - Immediately (e.g., < 1ms) ask the controller for status information
        that includes the motor's direction.
        - For OMS controllers the required delay is 10ms.  Intermittently, the
        status information returned from the OMS controller would indicate that
        the direction had not changed; hence the term "stale data".
        
        This problem was fixed by inserting a delay between the start of motor
        motion and the first status update.  Unfortunately, the delay was
        implemented in such a way as to have an undesirable side effect for VME
        based controllers (i.e., OMS) that interrupt on motion complete.
        Namely, if the motor move time was less than approximately two VxWorks
        system clock ticks (33.33 ms for a 60HZ system clock), than the
        response time to the controller signally motion complete was based on
        the polling rate, rather than the done interrupt latency.

        This problem has been fixed by having query_axis() in motordrvCom.c
        return the remaining delay time to motor_task(), so that motor_task()
        can delay for the remainder of the delay rather than the larger polling
        rate.
        
        In order to avoid having all device drivers delay for the maximum
        stale data delay time, each device driver now passes the stale data
        delay time in the "thread_args" structure at "motor_task" thread
        creation.

        Files modified: - numerous changes to motordrvCom.cc
                        - "update_delay" added to thread_args in motordrvCom.h.
                        - "targs" modified in all drivers with "update_delay"
                          initialization.

5) With this release, if the absolute values of both the save/restore's target
        position and the controller's commanded position are greater than the
        re-try deadband (RDBD) at boot-up, then DVAL will be initialized from
        the controller's value.  In other words, if the absolute value of
        the controller's commanded position is greater than the re-try deadband
        at boot-up, than the controller's position takes precedence over the
        save/restore value.

        - Modified motor_init_record_com() in motordevCom.c so that a "Load
                Pos" command is issued only if,
                |controller's commanded position| > RDBD.

6) Bug fix for DMOV going true before last readback update when LS error occurs.

        File modified: process() in motorRecord.cc restores DMOV to false and
                        UNMARK's it so it is not posted until after the last
                        readback update.

7) A bug was introduced with R5-1 item #2 below.  This bug resulted in the STOP
        field not functioning after a target position change.  For example, if
        the user tweaked (TWF) the target position while the motor was moving,
        activating the STOP field would not stop motor motion the first time; a
        second STOP field activation would work.

        File modified: process() in motorRecord.cc.  Before calling
                        postProcess(), if the target position has changed
                        and MIP is not MIP_STOP or MIP_JOG_STOP, then set MIP
                        to MIP_DONE and let do_work() process the new target
                        position.

8) In order to avoid device level "Overriding invalid acceleration" warning
        messages, record support does not send SET_ACCEL commands when
        acceleration = 0.

        File modified: postProcess() and do_work() in motorRecord.cc.

9) Avoid STUP errors from devices that do not have a "GET_INFO" command (i.e.,
        Soft Channel).

        File modified: do_work in motorRecord.cc.  If WRITE_MSG(GET_INFO, NULL)
                        returns an error, set STUP to motorSTUP_OFF.

10) Added debug messages to Soft Channel device support and fixed error when
        devSoft.cc was compiled with "gcc version 3.4.2 20041017 (Red Hat
        3.4.2-6.fc3)".

        File modified: devSoft.cc

11) Kurt Goetze added support for the Physik Instrumente (PI) model C-630
        motion controller.

        Files added: to PiSrc directory; drvPIC630.h, devPIC630.cc,
                                         drvPIC630.cc

12) Bug fix for PI C-844 driver processing of axis #4.

        File modified: drvPIC844.cc, missing break"'s in axis #4 switch/case
                                        stmts. in set_status().

13) Added support for the Physik Instrumente (PI) GmbH & Co. C-848 motor
        controller.

        Files added:    - devPIC848.cc, drvPIC848.h, drvPIC848.cc

14) A bug was reported by David Maden that occurred when a motor was jogged
        into a limit switch with the DIR field set to "Neg".  Under these
        conditions, the motor record was not processing the limit error
        condition correctly.  This resulted in the motor record not setting
        either of the limit error indicator fields (HLS/LLS) and becoming stuck
        in the "Moving" state.

        File modified: do_work() in motorRecord.cc; complement CDIR when
                        jogging if DIR="Neg".

15) Added maximum communication timeout for all devices drivers (MAX_TIMEOUT).
        This value is set in motordrvCom.h to 5 seconds.  This helps prevent
        the "dev_NoInit (init_record_com: callback2 timeout" error message at
        motor record initialization.
        
        Files modified: - Added MAX_TIMEOUT to motordrvCom.h.
                        - Reference MAX_TIMEOUT in motor_init_record_com() in
                          motordevCom.cc.


Modification Log from R5-5 to R5-6
==================================

1) IMS MDrive modifications;
        1) Support flexible configuration of limit switches (see
                <motor>/motorApp/ImsSrc/README file).
        2) User must configure MDrives' Echo Mode Flag to two (EM=2).

        Files modified: drvIM483.h and drvMDrive.cc

2) Removed code from record level code that rounded-up absolute and relative
        positions before passing them on the device level code.  Any rounding
        required for controllers that communicate in integer values (motor
        steps) must be done at the device level.
        
        File modified: do_work() in motorRecord.cc

3) Modifications made to OMS device drivers that allow omsLib to be built, but
        not ran, for solaris and linux targets.

        Files modified: in motorApp/OmsSrc; Makefile, devOmsCom.cc, drvMAXv.cc,
                        drvOms.cc and drvOms58.cc

4) Override invalid acceleration rates and output an error message for OMS
        devices only.

        File modified: devOmsCom.cc

5) Replaced hardcoded task/thread stack size and priority values with generic
        OSI values in all epicsThreadCreate() calls.

        Files modified: All drivers.

6) Removed the MPF based directory <motor>/motorExApp/ipServerApp from the
        distribution.

        Files modified: Removed ipServerApp from <motor>/motorExApp/Makefile


Modification Log from R5-4 to R5-5
==================================


1) Removed the <motor>/motorExApp/Db directory.  R3.13.x  versions of the motor
        distribution needed some way to convert *.substitutions files into *.db
        files, because it could not rely on the synApps version of
        dbLoadTemplates().  This is not required with R3.14.x since "motor" is
        able to use the EPICS base version of dbLoadTemplates().  This, in
        turn, means that all the *.substitutions have been moved to their
        respective iocBoot directories and loaded directly by
        dbLoadTemplates().

2) The motor record would get into an invalid state when it attempted to
        perform a backlash correction move in the direction of an activated
        limit switch.

        File modified: - update CDIR in postProcess() in motorRecord.cc

3) Ported all affected device drivers to R4-1 of asyn.

        Files modified - all serial and/or GPIB based drivers.

4) Slew acceleration calculations were incorrect.  Instead of the correct
        calculation; A = (Vf - Vo) / t, the record was using A = Vf / t,
        which is correct only if Vo (VBAS) is zero.  Thanks to Harvey Rarback
        for pointing out this long standing error.

        File modified - motorRecord.cc

5) Modifications for EPICS R3.14.7 compatibility.

        Files modified - devSoftAux.cc; changes to epicsThread.h required
                         adding an explicit "#include <stdlib.h>".

6) Modifications for MicroSoft Visual C compiler compatibility.  Changed all
        occurrences of epicsExportAddress(); to extern "C"
        {epicsExportAddress();}.

        Files modified - most all.

7) Eliminated calls to devConnectInterrupt() due to C++ problems with devLib.h;
        i.e. "sorry, not implemented: `tree_list' not supported..." compiler
        error message.

        Files modified - drvOms.cc, drvOms58.cc and drvMAXv.cc

8) Omitted iocshRegister() call to resister PIC844Config().

        Files modified - PiRegister.cc

9) Added MM4006 to the list of controllers supported by the Newport MM4000
        device driver.

        Files modified - drvMM4000.cc


Modification Log from R5-3 to R5-4
==================================

1) Mark Rivers and I converted the motor record device drivers from MPF to
        ASYN.

        Files modified: too numerous to list.

2) OMS MAXv device support was added.

        Files added: to the motorApp/OmsSrc directory; drvMAXv.h, devMAXv.cc
                        and drvMAXv.cc.

3) In order to support the maximum number of motors per board for the Delta Tau
        PMAC motor controller (32), several changes have been made to all
        driver level code.

        - The "maximum number of axis per board" definition in motor.h
        (MAX_AXIS) was increased from 10 to 32.

        - The "driver_table" structure in motordrvCom.h was modified by
        changing the "axis_names" member from a "char *" to a "char **".  The
        third argument of the sendmsg() declaration was changed from a "char"
        to a "char *".

        - The "axis name" argument of sendmsg() was changed from a "char" to a
        "char *" in all drivers.  Those drivers that used the axis name
        argument of send_mess() were modified accordingly.

        - Those device drivers that defined an array of axis names in the
        driver (e.g., MAXv, PIC844) where redefined from an array of char's to
        an array of strings.
        
        Files modified: too numerous to list.

4) If the motor record is processed and there are no functions to perform
        (i.e., no current or outstanding move request) then the motor record
        will perform a status update using the STUP field.

        File modified: do_work() in motorRecord.cc determines that the record
                        is not being processed as a result of a call back and
                        that there is nothing to do.

5) Delta Tau PMAC device support was added.

        Files added: added the motorApp/DeltaTauSrc directory.
        

Modification Log from R5-2 to R5-3
==================================

1) The update (polling) rate for the "OMS VME8/44" device driver was incorrect.

        File modified: - omsSetup() in drvOms.cc.

2) When TWV is set to less than MRES, the following scenario would result.
        First, tweak forward (TWF).  Since DIFF < MRES, the motor is not moved.
        Next, tweak reverse (TWR).  Next TWF again.  The motor record does not
        respond; i.e., DVAL and RVAL are not updated; VAL is not posted.
        A single tweak, back and forth, confirms that the motor record is not
        responding.
        The problem was that do_work() in motorRecord.c was performing the "no
        move" test before testing for new positions and posting new positions.

        File modified: - do_work() in motorRecord.cc

3) The motor record would lock-up when a user tried to move off an activated
        limit switch with the OMS VME58 servo motor controller board (i.e.,
        model -8S).  See above "Known Problems" item #3.

        File modified: - set_status() in drvOms58.cc; had to force CDIR to
                        match the limit switch polarity for record level code
                        to see the limit switch error condition.
                        
4) Added the STUP field (Status Update) to the motor record that allows
        continuous status updates.  The STUP field functions as follows;

        - the valid values for STUP are OFF(0), ON(1) and BUSY(2).

        - a Channel Access (CA) client writes ON(1) to the STUP field which
        causes the motor record to set STUP to BUSY(2) and request a single
        controller status update.  After the status is updated the record sets
        STUP to OFF(0).

        - CA client are restricted to writing ON(1) to STUP only when STUP is
        OFF(0).

        - it is the responsibility of the user to restrict the frequency (and
        thus the incurred overhead) at which the CA client writes ON(1) to
        STUP.

        With the STUP field it is possible to have another EPICS record whose
        SCAN field (e.g.,  Calcout record) is set to periodically scan.  This
        record could periodically write ON(1) to the motor record's STUP
        field.  This would result in continuous, periodic status updates.
        Under certain circumstances, item #2 under "Known Problems" will occur
        with the use of STUP.  This will be fixed in a later release.

        Files modified: - MotorSrc/motorRecord.dbd
                        - MotorSrc/motorRecord.cc

5) Eliminated the erroneous "Motor motion timeout ERROR" that would occur if
        the user repeats 10 consecutive commands that include a controller
        update command (i.e., INFO) without any intervening motor moves.
        Modified all drivers to suspend incrementing the "no_motion_count" when
        the motor is not moving.

        Files modified: - set_status() in all drivers.

6) PID parameters (i.e., PCOF, ICOF and DCOF fields) were not initialized at
        boot-up.  With this release, if the GAIN_SUPPORT bit in the MSTA is
        true, each nonzero, PID parameter will be initialized.  For backwards
        compatibility, zero valued PID parameters will not be initialized.

        File modified:    motor_init_record_com() in motordevCom.cc

7) A bug was introduced when item #2, under R5.1 was fixed. This error
        occurred when the SET/USE field was in the SET mode and the FOFF field
        was in the FROZEN mode.  Under these conditions, if the user entered
        a new RVAL, the record ignored every other new RVAL; with every other
        new DVAL that the user entered, RVAL was not updated.  VAL always
        worked.

        File modified:  - load_pos() in motorRecord.c modified so that LVAL
                                is updated when FOFF is in the FROZEN mode.

8) Item#5 under R5-2 was not fixed.  There was still a problem in the logic
        that enforced a time delay between UNDEFINED or IMMEDIATE type commands.
        On OMS VME58 controllers an INFO update after a LOAD_POS command would,
        intermittently, yield the previous position.

        File modified: process_messages() in motordrvCom.cc modified so that a
                        valid "delay" in process_messages() is limited to,
                        0 <= delay <= (quantum * 2).

9) Previous releases of the motor record forced the sign of ERES to match the
        sign of MRES.  With this release, ERES and MRES may have different
        signs.  This allows the user to change the sign of ERES rather than
        reverse encoder wires when the motor and encoder direction are
        reversed.  Warning! This does not work with controllers that are doing
        closed-loop control; e.g., DC motors.  Reference (D/A) and feedback
        (encoder) signals must have the same polarity for DC motors or the
        motor will literally run away.

        File modified: do_work() in motorRecord.cc

10) Previous releases of the IMS MDrive device driver did not work.  Thanks to
        Kevin M. Peterson (UNI-CAT) for identifying and fixing the errors in
        previous releases.  A README file has been added to the ImsSrc
        directory that documents how the MDrive must be initialized before
        using it with this device driver.

        Files modified: - Added README file.
                        - drvMDrive.cc; incorporated Kevin's modifications.
                        - devMDrive.cc; Added encoder support.

11) The following three device drivers have been ported from the R3.13.x
        compatible version of the motor record:
        - the Physik Instrumente (PI) GmbH & Co. C-844 motor controller.
        - Kevin Peterson's support for the MicroMo MVP 2001 B02 controller.
        - Kurt Goetze's support for the Micos MoCo dc controller.


Modification Log from R5-1 to R5-2
==================================

1) Communication with the Newport MM3000 motor controller was getting out of
        synchronization whenever the MM3000 responded with an error message.
        This problem was resolved by having recv_mess() in drvMM3000.c detect
        an error message response, print the error message and then,
        recursively, call itself.  This restored communication transmit/receive
        synchronization.
        File modified: - recv_mess() in drvMM3000.cc

2) Spurious interrupts were occurring with OMS VX2-006 ver 1.04 controller
        boards.  For the sake of throughput, the OMS VME8/44 device driver
        enables the done (DON_E) and input buffer full (IBF_E) interrupts, but
        disables the transmit buffer empty (TBE_E).

        The OMS boards are RORA VME type interrupters.  The "release" register
        is the status register.  It contains information on the status of the
        transmit/receive buffer interrupts and the done interrupt.  Since the
        device driver was not using the transmit buffer empty interrupt, it was
        polling the status register when sending a command to the controller.
        With the VX2, if the IRQ became active during a status register read
        cycle, the IRQ was negated at the end of the cycle and the CPU board
        generated a spurious interrupt.
        
        The VME8/44 models somehow prevented the spurious interrupts from
        occurring by latching the IRQ, if and when, the IRQ became active
        during a status register read.
        
        This problem has been fixed by using all of the OMS board interrupts
        (i.e., enable transmit buffer empty).  The OMS VME8/44/VX2/VS4 design
        is limited with regard to interrupts by an all or none choice.

        In addition, the following modifications were made to the OMS8/44
        device driver;
        - Moved the OMS specific data structure "irqdatastr" from motordrvCom.h
        to drvOms.h.
        - Changed recv_rng and send_rng in irqdatastr from C to C++ interface.
        - Added epicsThreadSleep() calls to omsGet() and omsPut() in drvOms.cc
        during delays.
        
        Files modified: - OmsSrc/drvOms.h; enable TBE_E interrupt.
                        - OmsSrc/drvOms.cc; support TBE_E interrupt.
                        - MotorSrc/motordrvCom.h

3) With release R4-7, there was a slight (undocumented) modification made to
        the way that backlash correction functioned. If a move is in the
        preferred direction and the backlash speed and acceleration are the
        same as the slew speed and acceleration, then the backlash move is
        skipped and the motor moves directly to the target position.
        
        Unfortunately, there was a bug in the logic that appeared only when MRES
        < 0.  When MRES < 0, and the backlash speed and acceleration were the
        same as the slew speed and acceleration, the motor record did the
        opposite of the requirements; i.e., it did backlash correction when the
        move was in the preferred direction and did not do backlash correction
        when the move was not in the preferred direction.

        File modified: - do_work() in motorRecord.cc

4) The Newport ESP300 would randomly crash at boot-up because an internal
        parameter ("drive_resolution") was not always, under all
        configurations, initialized.  With this release, the "drive_resolution"
        is set based on the response to the ESP300 "SU?" command.  In addition,
        the user is required to set MRES to the resolution of the controller as
        explained in the new document <motor>/motorApp/NewportSrc/README.
        
        Files modified: - NewportSrc/devESP300.c
                        - NewportSrc/drvESP300.c
        File added:     - NewportSrc/README (notes on serial communication and
                                ESP300 configuration).

5) There were two timing related bugs with the previous release (R5.1).  First,
        the update rate was not working properly.  The end result was that the
        motor task was polling controllers as fast as possible.  Second, there
        was an error in the motor_task function process_messages() that
        enforces a time delay between UNDEFINED or IMMEDIATE type commands
        (e.g., LOAD_POS, SET_ENC_RATIO, etc.) and an INFO type command.  One
        result of this error was that on OMS VME58 controllers an INFO update
        after a LOAD_POS command would, intermittently, yield the previous
        position.

        File modified: motor_task() and process_messages() in motordrvCom.cc

6) Backlash correction after jogging was not working for controllers that do
        not support multiple position commands on the same command line (e.g.,
        Newport ESP300).  This has been corrected with this release with one
        caveat; in contrast to the feature described in item#3 above, backlash
        correction is always done after jogging, regardless of the jog
        acceleration and speed parameters.

        File modified: Added extra jog backlash states to postProcess() in
                        motorRecord.cc

7) Although there is no explicit statement in the motor record documentation,
        most user's would expect the "Readback settle time" field (DLY) to
        update the readback after the delay timeout.  It did not do this.
        With this release, the readback is updated one time after the timeout.

        Since a functioning DLY field performs the same function as the
        drv<driver>ReadbackDelay variables, with the added advantage that the
        delay can be motor specific, the drv<driver>ReadbackDelay variables
        have been deleted (except for the MM4000).
        
        File modified: - callbackFunc() and process() in motorRecord.cc


Modification Log from R4-5 to R5-1
==================================

1) The following scenario would put the motor record into an invalid state.
        A new target position (i.e., VAL/DVAL/RVAL) is written to the motor
        record under the following conditions,

        - motion is in progress (i.e., DMOV is false).
        - the new target position is different from the actual position by less
        than the retry deadband (|DIFF| < RDBD).
        - backlash correction is enabled (i.e., BDST is non-zero) and the new
        move is NOT in the "preferred direction" (preferred direction is the
        direction in which the motor moves during the backlash-takeout part of
        a motor move).

        File modified: do_work() in motorRecord.cc.  Update last target
                        positions and set DMOV TRUE, only if the motion in
                        progress indicator (MIP) is DONE.

2) A bug was introduced in R4-5 when backlash correction was changed per item
        #11 below.  The error occurred when a new target position was issued
        while the motor was moving.  The motor would move to the new target
        position at the backlash velocity rather than the slew velocity.
        This bug was discovered by Kevin M. Peterson.
        
        File modified: process() in motorRecord.cc.  Before calling
                        postProcess() check if the target position has changed.

3) A conflict between the requirements specified in item #2 below and the goal
        of having the same record level functionality for all device drivers,
        including Soft Channel device support, was found by Tim Graber.

        A problem occurred with, for example, the SoftMotorEx.db that is
        distributed with the motor record, when backlash was enabled in the
        "hard" motor.  The result was that the "soft" motor would interpret
        the "hard" motor's backlash correction as the motor going in the wrong
        direction, and stop the "hard" motor from completing the backlash
        correction.

        With this release, the requirements on how the motor record processes a
        new target position while the motor is in motion have been modified
        based on a new field; New Target Monitor (NTM).

        Case #1: The motor record is given a new position, which is in the
        opposite direction from the current motor motion.
        If NTM is YES, the motor is immediately stopped and given a motion
        command to the new position.
        If NTM is NO, the motor completes the previous move before it is given
        a motion command to the new position.
        
        Case #2: The motor record is given a new position, which is in the
        same direction as the current motor motion, but the new position is
        closer to the motor's current position than the original target
        position.
        If NTM is YES, the motor is stopped after it has gone past the new
        position; then a command is given to return to the new position.
        If NTM is NO, the motor completes the previous move before it is given
        a motion command to the new position.

        Case #3: The motor record is given a new position, which is in the
        same direction as the current motor motion, but the new position is
        further from the motor's current position than the original position.
        After the motor reaches the original target position and stops, a
        command is given to the new target position.  This case is independent
        of NTM.

        Files modified: - NTM field added to motorRecord.dbd
                        - process() in motorRecord.cc checks NTM field before
                                sending stop motor command.

4) A Soft Channel device support design limitation was discovered by Tim
        Mooney.  The problem is a result of the modifications made with R4-5,
        item #5 below, where the "soft" motor synchronizes it's target position
        (i.e., VAL/DVAL/RVAL) with it's readback/raw position (RBV/DRBV/RRBV).
        
        Given an application where there are two or more "soft" motors driving
        the system (e.g., slit), when one soft motor is moved, the other soft
        motor "sees" it's readback changing and synchronizes it's target position
        with it's readback position at the end of the move, thereby losing it's
        target position.
        
        With this release, the LOCK field has been added to prevent
        synchronization due to the readback changing.
        
        Files modified: - LOCK field added to motorRecord.dbd
                        - soft_dinp_func() in devSoft.cc checks LOCK field
                                before putting dinp_value into HARDMOVE state.


5) Device driver support added for the Newport ESP300 motor controller.
        Files added: - NewportSrc/devESP300.cc
                     - NewportSrc/drvESP300.cc

6) An uninitialized pointer error check was omitted from a Newport ESP300
        device function.  This resulted in a bus error at boot-up if the IOC
        failed to connect to the ESP300 controller.
        
        File modified: ESP300_init_record() in the devESP300.cc

7) "device directive" support has been extended to the PREM and POST fields for
        OMS devices only.  The new device directive supports changing the value
        of a database variable.  The syntax is as follows:

        PREM - @PUT(<pvname>, <pv-value>, <delay in seconds>)@
        POST - @PUT(<pvname>, <pv-value>)@

        Note that the PREM supports a delay argument, but that POST does not.
        The "Readback settle time" field (DLY) should be used to create a time
        delay after the PV specified in the POST field is written.  See the
        "Miscellaneous fields" in motorRecord.html for further information on
        the INIT, PREM and POST fields.

        Files modified: devOmsCom.cc, drvOms58.cc and drvOms.cc

8) Device driver support added for the Intelligent Motion Systems (IMS)
        MDrive17 model motor controller.
        
        Files modified: - [dev/drv]MDrive.cd added to ImsSrc/Makefile.Vx
                        - "MDrive" device and driver added to devImsMotor.dbd
        Files added:    - [dev/drv]MDrive.cd added to ImsSrc directory.

9) Eliminated redundant DMOV monitor posting's.  For example, with previous
        releases the motor record would post DMOV=0 twice if backlash
        correction was enabled and the user jogged the motor.
        
        Files modified: modified postProcess(), process() and load_pos()
                        in motorRecord.cc.

10) A Home Velocity field (HVEL) was added.
        Files modified: - HVEL added to motorRecord.dbd
                        - motorRecord.cc
                        - op/adl/motorx_setup.adl

11) There is a problem with OMS VME58 ver 2.35-8 firmware when used with
        MVME2700 CPU boards.  The problem is that the controller board
        intermittently, reports that there is no limit switch error when there
        is an error.  This error can occur if the user repeatedly, tries to
        move in the direction of the limit switch when the limit error
        condition exits.  A delay has been added to work around the problem.

        File modified: - drvOms58.cc; conditional delay added to query_done().

12) With release R4-5, DBE_LOG was omitted from the event select mask of all
        db_post_events() calls.  This prevented archival clients from being
        notified of process variable changes.  With this release, DBE_LOG is
        on for all calls to db_post_events()
        
        Files modified: - motorRecord.cc, motordevCom.cc and devSoft.cc

13) Mark Rivers added support for the Mclennan PM600 controller.

        Files modified: - MclennanSrc/devPM304.cc
                        - MclennanSrc/drvPM304.cc
                        - MclennanSrc/drvPM304.h

14) MX device driver support added.  MXmotorSrc directory added.


Modification Log from R4-4 to R4-5
==================================

1) The GPIB and RS232 serial communication error detection and reporting
        mechanism was unreliable.  In addition, once a communication error was
        detected, the motor task did endless periodic communication retries.
        With this release, once a communication error is detected, one retry
        is attempted (Further retries are made, if the position RETRY field is
        non-zero).  If the retry fails, then a communication error is
        reported.  No further attempt is made to communicate with the
        controller until subsequent user input (e.g., a new target position is
        entered).  This change affects all device drivers using GPIB or RS232
        serial communication mechanisms (i.e., non-VME Bus boards).
        
        Files modified: motordrvCom.h - added RETRY to CommStatus enumeration.
        drvMM4000.c, drvMM3000.c, drvPM500.c, drvIM483PL.c, drvIM483SM.c
        - start_status() allows one retry after a communication error.
        - set_status() sets RA_PROBLEM along with CNTRL_COMM_ERR to terminate
                node.

2) The requirements on how the motor record processes a new target position
        while the motor is in motion have never been specified.  The
        requirements are as follows:

        Case #1: The motor record is given a new position, which is in the
        opposite direction from the current motor motion.  The motor is
        immediately stopped and given a motion command to the new position.
        
        Case #2: The motor record is given a new position, which is in the
        same direction as the current motor motion, but the new position is
        closer to the motor's current position than the original target
        position.  The motor is stopped after it has gone past the new
        position; then a command is given to return to the new position.

        Case #3: The motor record is given a new position, which is in the
        same direction as the current motor motion, but the new position is
        further from the motor's current position than the original position.
        After the motor reaches the original target position and stops, a
        command is given to the new target position.  (Previous motor record
        versions ignored the new target position.)
        
        File modified: * process() in motorRecord.c
                       * motorRecord.dbd - the PP field is initially zero.
                                         - replaced PDIF with CDIR field.

3) For two CPU board configurations only (i.e., EPICS and IP satellite boards),
        erroneous timeouts occurred if the EPICS board booted much faster than
        the satellite board.
        
        File modified: CommSrc/serialIOMPF.cc; increased timeout from 2 to 10
                        seconds in call to msgQReceive() from serialIO().

4) The "Driver Power Monitoring" feature (available only with OMS VME58
        controllers) was erroneously and randomly being enabled.  This
        occurred because the internal state indicator (dpm) was never
        initialized to OFF at boot-up.
        
        File modified: motor_init_record_com() in motordevCom.c.  Explicitly
                        initialize "dpm" to OFF.

5) The Soft Channel device support modifications:
        - Prevent record processing before "interruptAccept" is true.  This
        helps prevent alarms.
        - If the readback is changing, but motion was not initiated by this
        record, then reset the motor record's target to actual position (i.e.,
        VAL/DVAL/RVAL = RBV/DRBV/RRBV) after the move.  As always, the Soft
        Channel motor record's DMOV field is guaranteed to execute and post a
        1/0/1 pulse, but MOVN remains zero throughout a move that was not
        initiated by the Soft Channel record.
        - Lowered the priority of the "soft_motor task below the "dbCaLink"
        task.  This fixes the "DMOV processing before the last DRBV update"
        problem.
         
        Files modified: - devSoft.h, devSoft.c, devAuxSoft.c

6) For VMEbus based motor controllers only (i.e., OMS), a "hole" in an array
        of VME based motor controller boards caused the system to crash with
        a memory "access error" on the address of the missing controller.
        For example, if oms58Setup(3, 8, 0x4000, 190, 5, 10) was issued without
        a board at 0xFFFF5000, a bus error would occur if the user attempted
        to move a motor on the missing board.

        Files modified: drvOms58.c - start_status() was not checking for valid
                                        motor_state[card] pointer.
                        drvOms.c,drvOms58.c - "total_cards" changed from total
                                detected to total cards that "memory is
                                allocated for".  This allows boards after the
                                "hole" to work.

7) For OMS motor controllers only, if the PREM field was set without a leading
        space character (e.g., "BH8") this resulted in an invalid OMS command
        (e.g., "AX VB10 VL1000 AC5000BH1 MA200 GD ID").

        File modified: devOmsCom.c - A space character was prefixed to the
                                        PREM field in oms_build_trans().

8) Eliminated support for the "ASCII record separator (IS2) = /x1E".

        Files modified:
                - MotorSrc/motordrvCom.c: Removed support for splitting and
                shuffling concatenated command messages in query_axis().
                - ImsSrc/devIM483[SM/PL].c: Moved the calls to
                motor_[start/end]_trans_com() into IM483[SM/PL]_build_trans().
                Don't call motor_end_trans_com() if motor command is a NOOP. 

9) With previous releases of the motor record, the RES field was set to either
        ERES or MRES, based on whether or not the following statement was true;
        MSTA indicates an encoder is present, AND, UEIP is set to YES.  This
        state (i.e., MSTA indicates an encoder is present, AND, UEIP is set to
        YES) resulted in the record converting all position and velocity
        related values from EGU's to raw encoder counts before sending them to
        the motor controller.  This is the manner in which the OMS controllers
        work (see OMS User's Manual, ER# command).
        With this release, all raw positions, velocity and acceleration are
        in terms of motor steps.
        - RES always equal to MRES.  RES preserved for backward compatibility
                only.  All instances of RES have been replaced with MRES.

        Files modified: - MotorSrc/motor.h
                        - MotorSrc/motorRecord.c
                        - MotorSrc/motordevCom.c
                        - OmsSrc/devOmsCom.c
                        - NewportSrc/devMM3000.c

                        - NewportSrc/devPM500.c
                        - ImsSrc/devIM483PL.c
                        - ImsSrc/devIM483SM.c
                        - V544Src/devV544.c

10) Jog velocity was not checked for validity when VMAX or VBAS was changed.
        Files modified: MotorSrc/motorRecord.c, added JVEL error check in
                        special().

11) Previous motor record releases put both the "slew" and backlash correction
        moves on the same motor controller command line.  Some controllers
        (i.e., OMS) handled this correctly by processing the slew move followed
        by the backlash correction move.  Other controllers (i.e, Newport) did
        not handle this correctly and processed the commands immediately,
        resulting in the controller moving to the target position without
        backlash correction, but at the backlash correction velocity.

        With this release, backlash correction commands are not issued to the
        controller until after the slew move is completed.
        
        File modified:  MotorSrc/motorRecord.c
                - Moved the backlash commands from do_work() to postProcess().
                - Added a MIP_MOVE_BL state indicator.
                - Eliminated redundant MARK(M_MIP)'s.
                - Combined MIP_MOVE with MIP_JOG_STOP logic in postProcess().

12) Mark Rivers has added device driver support for the following motor
        controllers:

                - Advanced Control Systems, Corp. model MCB-4B.
                - Mclennan model PM304.

13) motor_callback() in motordevCom.c calls dbProcess(), rather than calling
        motor record process() directly.  This supports standard database
        processing functions like TPRO and breakpoints.

14) Update <motor>/config files to synApps R4.4 and epics base 3.13.5:

        Files modified:
                RULES.Db - added "depends::"
                makeConfigAppInclude.pl - updated to synApps R4.4 version.
                makeIocCdCommands.pl    - updated to synApps R4.4 version

15) Some databases where converted to VDCT; i.e., motor.db, SoftMotorEx.db.

16) Added separate +/- limit switch status bits in the MSTA field.  There are
        two types of motor controllers.  The first type provides a limit switch
        error and a direction indicator, the second type provides the state of
        both limit switches, but no direction indicator.  In the first case,
        the device driver knows that an error has occurred, that motion has
        stopped,  and that based on the direction indicator, which limit switch
        was activated.  In the second case the device driver must determine,
        based on the limit switch states and an internally generated direction
        indicator, whether or not a limit switch error has occurred.  The OMS
        controllers are an example of the first type of controller and the
        IM483 is an example of the second type of controller.

                         - All drivers; i.e., */drv*.c

17) Post all fields when recGblResetAlarms() returns an alarm.


Modification Log from R4-3 to R4-4
==================================

1) config/RELEASE: - Changed comments to indicate that MPF_SERIAL must be
                     defined if either serial or GPIB communication is
                     required.
                   - Updated support modules to latest releases;
                     mpfSerial R1-2, MPF R1-6, EPICS base R3-13-4.

2) Examples: - iocBoot/iocNoMPF/st.cmd; added GDCT compatible Soft Channel
               device driver example.
             - iocBoot/iocWithMPF/[st.cmd and st_mpfserver.cmd]; for 1 CPU
               configuration, both initGpibGsTi9914() and
               HiDEOSGpibLinkConfig() must have the same GPIB server name.
             - motorExApp/Db/[SoftMotorEx.db andSoftMotorEx] ; added a GDCT
               compatible Soft channel device driver database example.

3) Jog Velocity and Acceleration.  Two new fields (JVEL and JAR) were added to
        support jog velocity and acceleration parameters.  Only the OMS and IMS
        device drivers support changing the Jog Velocity while jogging.
        Files modified: motorRecord.dbd - Jog specific fields (JVEL and JAR).
                        motorRecord.c - Process JVEL in special().
                        devIM483[PL/SM].c, devMM[3/4]000.c,
                        devPM500.c, - Added Jog Velocity motor command.
                        devOmsCom.c - Added clear axis done flag command (CA)
                                        to home and jog commands.  This is
                                        needed so that JVEL does not see
                                        done from previous command.

4) Travel limits can be disabled by setting both the dial high and low limits
        equal to zero; i.e., DHLM = DLLM = 0.
        File modified: motorRecord.c

5) A problem was discovered with entering target positions through RVAL.  If
        the difference between the current and the next target position (i.e.,
        RDIF, DIFF) was less than the retry deadband (RDBD), and the next
        target position was in the "preferred direction", then the new RVAL
        was ignored.
        File modified: motorRecord.c - Root cause in do_work() was that under
                        the above conditions, LVAL was not updated.

6) The following scenario would put the motor record into an invalid state.
        First, start the motor moving by giving it a new target position.
        Next, while the motor is still moving, enter a new target position that
        is beyond the software travel limit (HLM/LLM) .  The invalid target
        position is rejected (as it should be), but when the first target
        position is reached the MIP field is left in the MOVE state, rather
        than the DONE state.
        File modified: motorRecord.c - Modified do_work() LVIO logic to set
                                       DMOV true only if MIP is DONE.

7) Removed Hideos file motorApp/CommSrc/serialIO.cc from distribution.

8) The following scenario would put the motor record into an invalid state.
        At the end of a move a "retry" is requested.  The MIP field is set to
        RETRY in maybeRetry(), but before the retry request can be processed
        in do_work() the STOP field is set TRUE.  This results in a STOP
        command being issued, but no subsequent processing callbacks, which
        leaves the record's MIP in the STOP state and DMOV false.
        File modified: motorRecord.c - Modified do_work() STOP and SPMG
             processing to set MIP <- DONE and DMOV <- TRUE when MIP == RETRY.

9) As suggested by Brian McAllister, type specifications for all bit-fields
        found within unions have been changed to "int".  This modification
        elminates the ANSI warning messages and has no effect on the machine

Modification Log from R4-2 to R4-3
==================================

1) An error was introduced into the motor record when item #14 under R4-2 was
implemented.  This error occurred if the STOP field was activated when the
motor was not moving (i.e., MIP = 0).  The motor record would become "stuck",
and not respond to a move request (due to the internal state machine associated
with MIP being set to the "stop" state), until the condition was cleared by
either a SPMG-stop or some other user action that forced the MIP field to zero.
        File modified: motorRecord.c - Changed logic in do_work() so that the
                stop command is always sent to the controller when the STOP
                field is activated; but, the MIP field in only set to the
                "stop" state if the current state is not STOP or DONE.

2) Due to ambiguous and conflicting Newport PM500 documentation, the velocity
and acceleration values for the PM500 controller were off by a factor of 1,000.
        File modified: devPM500.c - Scaled velocity, acceleration and jogging
                command parameters by 1,000.

3) HIDEOS is no longer supported.
        Files modified: config/RELEASE - Removed HIDEOS path.
                        motorApp/CommSrc/Makefile.Vx - Removed HIDEOS.

4) Added Mark Rivers soft channel modifications as a conditional compilation
option (i.e., DMR_SOFTMOTOR_MODS).
        Files modified: motorApp/MotorSrc/Makefile.Vx
                        motorApp/MotorSrc/motorRecord.c
                        motorApp/SoftMotorSrc/Makefile.Vx
                        motorApp/SoftMotorSrc/devSoft.h
                        motorApp/SoftMotorSrc/devSoft.c

5) The Soft Channel device driver example, softex.db, was removed from
motorExApp/Db and replaced with a GDCT compatible copy, SoftMotorEx.db.  The
corresponding GDCT data file is SoftMotorEx.
                        


Modification Log from R4-1 to R4-2
==================================

1) The following requirement was lost with release V4.0.  At boot-up, if one
field of a field pair (i.e., VMAX/SMAX, VBAS/SBAS, VELO/S, BVEL/SBAK) is zero
and the other field is nonzero, the nonzero field takes precedence.  If both
fields of a given field pair are nonzero, the RPS member of the field pair
(i.e., SMAX, SBAS, S, SBAK) takes precedence.
        File modified: motorRecord.c - Changed logic in
                        check_speed_and_resolution().

2) An error was introduced into the Oms device support with V4.0.  The 1st
argument of the omsSetup(nCards, ...) function in the st.cmd file is for the
maximum number of VME8 and/or VME44 cards to be supported in a specific IOC
crate.  If the "nCards" argument was set to anything other than the actual
number of cards in the IOC crate, the "dbior" function would result in
erroneous information or a bus error.
        File modified: drvOms.c - Restored statement in motor_init() that sets
                        motor_state[] to NULL when card not found.

3) An error occurs with the OMS VME58 when the user runs the motor into a
limit switch and then attempts to move away from the limit switch.  If either
an absolute or incremental move is utilized to move away from the limit switch,
the OMS VME58 ignores the 1st move attempt.  Subsequent moves work.  In
addition, the user can jog off a limit switch.  This error was hidden in most
applications if RTRY was nonzero.
        File modified: devOmsCom.c - Changed logic in oms_build_trans() to
                        prefix MP or MM command to any move when overtravel
                        status indicator is ON.

4) Added support for EPICS GPIB Module Version 0-0 from Benjamin Franksen.
Warning! Neither GPIB 0-0 are my usage of it has been throughly tested yet.
        Files modified: config/RELEASE - Configuration instructions added.
                        CommSrc/Makefile.Vx - Conditional compilation label.
                        CommSrc/gpibIO.c - Conditional compilation for
                                                unbundled GPIB module.

5) All motorApp/*/Makefile.Vx files were modified to take advantage of the
macro found in Benjamin Franksen's makefiles; i.e.,
LIBOBJS = $(SRCS.c:../%.c=%.o)

6) Replaced all occurrences of "include <stdioLib.h>" with "include <stdio.h>.
Wind River has labeled stdioLib.h as "obsolete vxWorks 5.0 header file".
        Files modified: drvOms.c, drvOms58.c, devMM3000.c, devMM4000.c,
                        drvMM3000.c, drvMM4000.c

7) Added support for the Newport PM500 motion controller.  This device/driver
is based on Mark River's PM500 V2.0 release. 
        Files added: devPM500.c and drvPM500.c

8) Removed QUERY from the list of valid "command types".  It was unused.
Enumerated message types.
        File modified: motordrvCom.h and motordrvCom.c

9) Some motor controllers (e.g., PM500) unconditionally respond when motor
commands are sent.  Although these communication responses are not needed
(they are in fact a nuisance), they must be received so that later communication
transactions are kept in synchronization.  To this end, a flag was added to the
"controller" structure to indicate where or not the associated motor controller
responds to all commands.
        Files modified: motordrvCom.h - Added "cmnd_response" member to
                                        "controller".
                        motordrvCom.c - Get controller response if
                                        "cmnd_response" is set ON.
        drvMM3000.c, drvMM400.c, drvOms.c drvOms58.c - Initialize "cmnd_response".

10) Modifications were made to the following files to adopt Mark River's
method of command line termination; i.e., the send_mess() function appends
the command line termination character to the string.
        Files modified:
                motordrvCom.h
                motordrvCom.c   - Removed command line terminator argument from
                                  motor_send() and driver_table member, send().
                motordevCom.h   - Function declaration changes.
                motordevCom.c   - Removed command line terminator argument from
                                  motor_end_trans_com().

11) Added support for the Intelligent Motion Systems, Inc. IM483 controller.
Two device/driver versions are available; IM483PL for "party line" and IM483SM
for "single" communication mode.  See the IMS "Software Reference manual
Revision 051794 for detail.
        Directory added:        motorApp/ImsSrc
        Files added:            drvIM483.h, devImsMotor.dbd
                                devIM483SM.c, drvIM483SM.c
                                devIM483PL.c, drvIM483PL.c
        Files modified:         motorApp/Makefile - Added ImsSrc directory.

12) The record level support assumed that the motor controller would accept
two motion commands on the same command line.  This occurs when backlash
compensation is enabled.  Since the IM483[PL/SM] does not have this capability,
support for a command line "record separator" character was added.  The record
separator is defined as an ASCII (IS2) character = /x1E.  Currently, only one
record separator is allowed in a command line.
        Files modified:
                motordrvCom.c - process_messages() searches for a record
                                separator.  If found, it splits the message,
                                outputs the 1st part and stores the 2nd part
                                back into the front of the message buffer.
                              - query_axis() detects 2nd part of messages,
                                outputs it and clears the message buffer.
                                
                                
13) For those controllers whose command lines require an alphabetic character
for the axis name identifier (e.g. OMS, Oms58, IMS483PL), support has been
added for driver specific axis names.  An axis name array pointer was added to
the driver_table structure.
        Files modified:
                motordrvCom.h - Moved mess_card_query member axis_names to
                                driver_table.
                motordrvCom.c - The global oms_trans_axis[] was removed.
                motordevCom.h - Removed axis "name" member from axis_stat.
                motordevCom.c - Removed initial string function argument from
                                motor_start_trans_com().
                All drv{driver}.c files were modified to add an axis name
                                array point to their driver_table; (NULL for
                                device/drivers that do not use axis names;
                                e.g., MM3000, MM4000/5).                                        

14) An error was introduced in V4.0 which prevented the record from processing
a jog request if the UEIP field was changed.  Issuing a STOP or SPMG/STOP,
cleared the error.
        Files modified: motorRecord.c - Activate DMOV when loading a position
                                        (i.e., load_pos() called).

15) Removed unused C macros from driver level files.
        Files modified: - devMM3000.c, 

16) Records were stuck with DMOV = 0 if the user requested a move and there
was no underlying controller.  No error message, besides the "card does not
exist" message at boot-up, would appear.  With this release, the COMM_ALARM is
set and DMOV is reset if the controller does not exist.
        File modified: - motor_end_trans_com() in motordevCom.c

17) An error was introduced in V4.0 which prevented backlash correction from
occurring after a JOG.
        Files modified: postProcess() in motorRecord.c

18) Divide-by-zero errors were occurring in do_work() of motorRecord.c.
        File modified: Added various error checks in motorRecord.c against
                ERES becoming zero
                        
19) Two motion commands were being sent by do_work() if the record was
processed twice before a callback was processed.  This could occur under
various scenarios
        - banging on the tweak button with a low frequency update rate.
        - the motor record was (accidentally) processed from a periodic scan
                with a higher frequency than the update rate.
        File modified: In motorRecord.c, do_work(), changed the "motor moving"
                        test from the "movn" to the "mip" field.

20) An error was introduced into the motor record with V4.0.  This error
occurred on the rare occasion when a target position (i.e., VAL or DVAL)
fell almost exactly half way between two integer RVAL values, and the retry
feature was enabled (i.e., RTRY is nonzero).  The motor record would 'hang'
under these circumstances with DMOV set FALSE and RCNT set to one.
        Files modified: motorRecord.dbd - erroneous retries were a result of
                                round-off error.  Changed RES from a 'float'
                                to a 'double'.
                        motorRecord.c - Prior to V4.0, do_work() handled
                                retry request to the same position by setting
                                DMOV true and exiting (see code;
                                (npos == rpos)).  Broke this logic in V4.0
                                because of item #13.  Fixed, by testing for
                                MIP_RETRY, and clearing MIP.

21) Moved device specific structure "encoder_status" from motordrvCom.h to
drvOmsCom.h.
        Files modified: motordrvCom.h and drvOmsCom.h


Modification Log from R4-0 to R4-1
==================================

1) Three errors in the OMS VME58 driver were found.  All the errors caused the
same problem.  Namely, erroneous retries occurred intermittently when multiple
axes were commanded to move on the same controller.  This error occurred
because old position data was being passed back from the driver after Done
was detected.  The erroneous intermittent retries occurred more often when the
Oms setup parameters called for a high frequency (e.g., 60 Hz) "polling" rate
and Oms interrupts were enabled.
        File modified: drvOms58.c
        Function modifications:
                start_status()  - Wait forever for control register update bit
                                        to clear before setting.
                set_status()    - Request Data Area Update after DONE detected
                                        so that both ASCII command data and
                                        shared memory data match.
                motorIsr()      - Only write to control register if update bit
                                        is off (the ISR was clearing the
                                        update bit rather than the VME58 board.

2) Moved the Serial/GPIB communication label definitions from Newport specific
drvMMCom.h to the more general motordrvCom.h.  New motor controllers will
require these labels.
        Files modified: drvMMCom.h, motordrvCom.h, drvMM4000.c, drvMM3000.c

3) With previous releases, when using the motor record with soft channel
device support, the DMOV field would become stuck on if the user put the motor
in SET mode and entered a new DVAL or RVAL.  With this release, the above user
action (i.e., "setting" a soft motor) results in the record being processed;
which, in most cases, will clear DMOV.
        Files modified: devSoft.h, devSoft.c, devSoftAux.c

4) A problem with issuing a stop command (via either the STOP or SPMG field)
was found with ALL OMS boards and ALL versions of the OMS device drivers.  The
root cause of this problem is a statement in the OMS manual that is not
entirely correct; i.e., the AC and VL commands are not completely queued.

The motor record issues both the target move and the backlash move on the same
command line to the motor controller.  Each move (target and backlash) has its'
own acceleration rate.  The problem was that when a STOP command was issued
during the target move, the backlash acceleration would go into effect.  This
could result in a prolonged deceleration if the backlash acceleration rate
(BACC) is much smaller than the target acceleration rate (ACCL).

With this release both the devOms and the devOms58 device support issue the
target acceleration rate (ACCL) with the STOP command.
        File modified: devOmsCom.c


Modification Log from V3-5 to R4-0
==================================

1) EPICS base 3.13.1 compatibility.
        - Changed dev{Connect/Disconnect}Interrupt() to
                  dev{Connect/Disconnect}InterruptVME()
        Files modified: drvOms.c, drvOms58.c

2) Newport MM3000 Device Support.
        - Renamed drvMM400.h -> drvMMCom.h
        - Added device and driver support in source code files "devMM3000.c"
                and "drvMM3000.c".
        - Modified MM3000_build_trans() in "devMM3000.c" and
                motor_end_trans_com() in "motordevCom.c" to prevent motor
                commands from being sent if card does not exists.  Bus error
                occurred with MM3000 device/driver when card did not exists
                and motion was commanded from medm display.

3) Eliminated the GAIN field and the associated SET_CGAIN command;
        Files modified: motorRecord.dbd, motor.h, devMM3000.c, devMM4000.c,
        devOmsCom.c, and motorRecord.c

4) Previous releases of the motor record had a potential problem associated
        with the homing function.  The motorx_all.adl MEDM display set the
        HOM[F/R] fields on and off.  Depending on the pollRate defined in the
        st.cmd Setup command and the speed at which the user toggled the
        HOM[F/R] buttons; the record level software would turn off the DMOV
        field when the HOM[F/R] button was turned off and a motor status update
        had not yet been received.  As a result, when the motor completed it's
        homing function the command positions (i.e., VAL, DVAL, RVAL) were not
        updated.

        All previous motor record releases contained the DMOV problem; the
        commanded position update problem was limited to the previous release
        (V3.5).  With this release, a dbPutField to either HOMF or HOMR is
        valid on a FALSE to TRUE transition (i.e., 0 to 1), but a TRUE to FALSE
        transition (i.e., 1 to 0) will result in an error.

        - Modified motorRecord.dbd; added HOM[F/R] "special" processing.
        - Modified motorRecord.c; since OPI can't reset HOM[F/R], postProcess()
                does it; return error from special() if OPI tries to write to
                HOM[F/R] when MIP indicates homing active.

5) Previous releases of the motor record allowed the auto restore to take
        precedence over the controller when initializing the target position
        (i.e., DVAL).  With this release, if both the auto restore and
        controller target position values are non-zero at boot-up, then DVAL
        will be initialized from the controller's value.  In other words, the
        controller's target position takes precedence.

        - Modified motor_init_record_com() in motordevCom.c so that a "Load
                Pos" command is issued only if the position from the
                controller is zero.
                
6) Consolidated common driver local variables in the motordrvComCode.h file.
        - Created motordrvComCode.h
        - Moved common local variables from drvOms.c, drvOms58.c, drvMM3000.c,
                drvMM4000.c

7) Uninitialized Oms/Oms58 Driver Error Check. With previous release, if the
        Oms or Oms58 driver was some how omitted from the database, a "... card
        does not exist" error message would result.  With this release, an
        explicit error check and corresponding error message (i.e., "Oms[58]
        driver uninitialized.") results at record initialization if a required
        driver is not initialized. (Because of the particulars of MM[3000/4000]
        initialization, this is not an issue with Newport controllers.)

        - Added pointer to initialized indicator to driver table structure in
                motordrvCom.h
        - Added error checks in oms_init() and oms_end_trans() in both devOms.c
                and devOms58.c
        - For drvOms.c, drvOms58.c, drvMM3000.c and drvMM4000.c
                - initialized pointer to local initialized indicator in driver
                        table.
                - set initialized indicator ON in init().
                
8) Both the MM3000 and MM4000 device driver support could generate a bus error
        under the following conditions:
        1) The user selected GPIB communication mode.
        2) At boot-up, the driver could not communicate with the device,
                resulting in a "... card does not exist!" error.
        3) Motor motion is commanded.

        - Modified MM3000_build_trans() and MM4000_build_trans() in devMM3000.c
                and devMM4000.c, respectively, to test for NULL board pointer.
                

9) Eliminated MM3000 and MM4000 device driver "internal" offset.
        - Removed "offset" from MM3000_build_trans() and MM4000_build_trans()
                in devMM3000.c and devMM4000.c, respectively.
        - Read controller's home preset position at boot-up; save and restore
                save home preset position when "setting" DVAL or RVAL.

10) For MM4000/40005 only, the controller's position resolution (TU controller
        command) is read and saved so that the device driver can convert
        between motor record "raw" positions and controller egu's.

11) Modified report() in drvMM4000.c by adding message; "MM4000 controller #
        connection failed."

12) For the MM3000 when the GPIB communication interface is selected; sometimes
        the MM3000 returns a NULL communication response.  Hence, set_status()
        in drvMM3000.c was modified to detect a NULL response and resend the
        status query.

13) A jog request occurring during a jog induced backlash correction would,
        intermittently, cause the MM4000 to go into an uncontrolled jog; i.e.,
        the user would set JOG[F/R] false, but the jogging would not stop.
        This occurred because the sequence of events were as follows:
                <- mip = 0
        JOGF=1 ->
                <- mip = 1; Jog command
        JOGF=0 ->
                <- Stop command
                <- Done
                <- mip = 4; backlash command
        JOGF=1 ->
                <- Done
                <- mip = 1; Jog command
                <- mip = 4; backlash command
        JOGF=0 ->

        In the above event sequence, since mip=4 when JOGF is set to zero, no
        stop command is sent.  The MM4000 only accepts one motion command at
        a time.  Therefore, the last backlash command is ignored in the above
        event sequence.  The end result is an uncontrolled jog operation.
        
        Modifications were made to motorRecord.c to fix this; in general, a
        finite state machine was strictly enforced on jog request, jogging,
        stopping a jog and the backlash after jogging.  Jog processing is
        isolated from the JOG[F/R] fields.  Specifically,

        - Added two new state indicators to MIP; MIP_JOG_REQ and MIP_JOG_STOP.
                The jog states now consist of the following; Start (mip=0),
                Request, Jogging, Stopping and Backlash.
        - In postProcess();
                - replaced (MIP_JOGF | MIP_JOGR) with (MIP_JOG_STOP)
                when testing for done stopping after jogging.
                - replaced (pmr->jogf || pmr->jogr) with MIP_JOG_REQ
                when testing for done stopping after jog.
                - "Queued" jog request (stop and jog buttons both on)
                processing has been moved from postProcess() to do_work().
                - Skip backlash operation if backlash distance is zero.
        - In maybeRetry();
                - Clear MIP if Max retry count (RTRY) set to zero.
                - When clearing MIP, don't clear MIP_JOG_REQ.
        - In do_work();
                - Detect and process "Queued" jog request.
                - Use MIP state indicators rather than JOG[F/R] fields to
                process jog function.
                - Don't want "DVAL has changed..." logic to get processed when
                doing jog stop or backlash.  Detect and do Normal Return.
        - In special(); Set MIP_JOG_REQ on only if MIP=0 and the corresponding
                hardware limit switch is not active.

14) Eliminated device dependent code from process_messages() in motordrvCom.c;
        specifically, removed concatenating a carriage return to end of
        controller message.  The new method is to pass a pointer to the
        command line terminator string in function arguments; beginning with
        <device>_end_trans(), through motor_end_trans_com() in motordevCom.c,
        to the "send()" function specified in the driver table.
        Files modified: motordevCom.h, motordrvCom.h, devMM3000.c, devMM4000.c,
        devOms.c, devOms58.c

15) In motordrvCom.h, changed "controller" structure member "MMptr" to
        "DevicePrivate".
        Files modified: devMM3000.c, devMM4000.c

16) All files were modified as follows:
        - standard headers were added.
        - original headers and modification history's were restored.
        - all instances of #include <motorRecord.h> have been changed to
        #include "motorRecord.h".  As Mark Rivers explained, 'Include files
        which are in <> are not included in dependencies by GCC.  Thus, if
        motorRecord.dbd is changed, devMM4000.c will not be recompiled unless
        the <> are changed to "".'

17) The task name associated with each device driver has been given a unique
        name; i.e. "<device>_motor".  Previously, all the motor tasks were
        given the same task name, "tmotor".  This prevents using some of the
        Tornado tools (Browser, CrossWind, etc.).
        Files modified: drvMM3000.c, drvMM4000.c, drvOms.c, drvOms58.c

18) Removed my_strtok() from  and replace with VxWorks library function
        strtok_r().
        Files modified: drvMM3000.c, drvMM4000.c, drvOms.c, drvOms58.c

19) Added record report function for Oms driver.  File modified: drvOms.c

20) Added maximum allowable velocity fields; VMAX and SMAX.
        - VMAX/SMAX added to motorRecord.dbd with Access Security Limit = 0.
        - changed the Access Security Level for MRES, UREV, VBAS and SBAS from
        one to zero.
        - see motorRecord.html for valid velocity range limits.
        - optimized calls to fabs(pmr->urev).
        - added range_check() for validity checking bounded fields.
        - In order to support backup and restore functions, the range checking
        is done in such a way that the last minimum (i.e., VBAS/SBAS) or
        maximum (i.e., VMAX/SMAX) value entered is always valid.  For example,
        if the minimum is entered and it exceeds the maximum, then the maximum
        is set to the new minimum value.

21) With MM4000 device support, a tweak request (TWF/TWR) occurring during the
        processing of a previous tweak request, would intermittently leave the
        MIP field in a nonzero state (i.e., mip = 0x20).  A nonzero MIP field
        prevents processing a jog request.
        
        File modified: motorRecord.c
        Removed code that set DMOV TRUE.  See do_work() under the following
        logic;
            IF DVAL field has changed
                IF the SET position field is OFF
                    IF last dial commanded position = current dial feedback
                                                                position.

22) An infinite home velocity was being issued if the MSTA "encoder present"
        bit was on, ERES=0 and UEIP=NO.

        File modified: init_record() in motorRecord.c;
                if ERES = 0, set ERES <- MRES.

23) Setting MRES negative could invalidated comparisons between BDST and RES.
        File modified: motorRecord.c
                - in postProcess(), (pmr->bdst != 0.0) to (|BDST| < |RES|).
                - in do_work(), (|BDST| < RES) to (|BDST| < |RES|).

24) Moved OMS device specific code that enforced VELO > VBAS from do_work() in
        motorRecord.c to oms_build_trans() in devOmsCom.c

25) No longer put MM4000 in "remote mode".  User can do this by putting "MR;"
        in the INIT field.  File modified: drvMM4000.c

26) MM4000_build_trans() in devMM4000.c was overflowing its character buffer
        (i.e., buff) when processing a LOAD_POS command.  Increased buffer
        size to controller maximum (110) and added buffer overflow detection
        for both the local buffer and the "mess_node" message buffer.

27) Added model detection to MM4000/5 device driver.  The long term plan
        is to have the same source code support both MM4000 and MM4005
        controllers and use the "model" indicator to tailor the device
        driver support to either controller at run time.  With this release
        the "model" variable is used to ignore (i.e. NO-OP) the LOAD_POS motor
        command for the MM4005.  This is an interim solution until Newport
        releases controller firmware that explicitly supports a LOAD_POS
        command.
        Files modified: drvMMCom.h, drvMM4000.c and devMM4000.c

28) When a MM4000's motor resolution is small, the MM4000 communicates the
        motor's resolution in scientific notation.  The MM4000 driver was not
        processing the number of significant decimal points correctly when the
        controller used scientific notation for the motor resolution.
        Files modified: motor_init() in drvMM400.c

29) Through an odd set of circumstances the Oms58 driver was not performing
        status updates on PowerPC (PPC) platforms.  All users of the OMS VME58
        controller on a PPC platform must upgrade to Motor Record version 4.0
        for full functionality.
        Files modified: start_status() in drvOms58.c
        for (index = 0; index < total_cards; index++)
        {
            if((pmotor=(struct vmex_motor *) motor_state[card]->localaddr)!=0)
                                                             ^
                                                       wrong | index

30) A "Controller communication error" bit was allocated in the MSTA field.
        Currently, only the MM4000/5 device driver sets this error indicator.
        Files modified: motor.h, drvMMCom.h, motorRecord.c, drvMM4000.c

31) The "soft_motor" task (i.e., Soft channel device driver support task) was
        nearly running out of stack space.  Increased stack allocation from
        1,000 to 5,000 bytes.
