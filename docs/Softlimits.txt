Handling of soft limits in the motor module

Traditionally soft limits have been defined inside the motorRecord:
DHLM and DLLM
(or HLM and DLM, we focus on the dial coordinate system here)

The motorRecord itself makes sure that no movement is allowed that
violates the soft limits.
This works well for the movements that are commanded
through the motorRecord and e.g. "simple" stepper motor cards.

Modern motion controllers maintain their own soft limits,
which are often configured through a vendor-specific tool.

Having the soft limits in the motorRecord defined "wider" than
the values inside the motion controller leads to problems:
The controller refuses or restricts motion, goes into an error state
and the end user has a hard time to understand why.
Experiments may fail and what is going on may be hard to understand
for users.

To improve the situation, the motorRecord forwards changes of softlimits
into the driver.
See WRITE_MSG(SET_HIGH_LIMIT) and  WRITE_MSG(SET_LOW_LIMIT).

For a model 1 driver it is possible to "reject" those changes, when the soft
limits inside the controller are more restrictive than what the user wants.
This feature has never been implemented for a model 3 driver and the
asyn-ish handling makes this impossible, too.

As a replacement the "read only soft limits" have been introduced:
The driver can report soft limits from the controller and the
motorRecord will not allow a user to widen the driving range.


Recently the need arised for a different handling:
The controller calculates soft limits depending on the machine state,
and these should progress into the motorRecord, so that a user can see them.
(This is already possible)

Independent of this, the user should be able to overwrite the
"read only soft limits" inside the controller. (This was not possible)

A new "read write softlimits" feature is now in place, which has 2 functions:
- The driver can disable the soft limits inside the motorRecord
  (DHLM==DLLM==0.0)
  (The handling of read only soft limits is not changed:
   When the driver reports "no soft limits" the motorRecord
   values stay as they are. A user is then allowed to change them)
 - The user is allowed to change the softlimits in the motorRecord
   and extent the driving range or disable them.
   These values are then forwarded into the driver (as before) and
   the driver can update the motion controller.
   Note: The motion controller will then use them for e.g. trajectory scans.

In order to enable the read write soft limis a configuration bit
in the MFLG has been defined: MF_RW_SOFT_LIMITS
There are 2 ways to change the "read only soft limits" into
"read write soft limits":
a) The bit MF_RW_SOFT_LIMITS  in MFLG is set inside the db or template file.
b) The driver calls
setIntegerParam(pC_->motorFlagsRwSoftLimits_, 1);
which will set the bit inside the MFLG field.

Implementation notes:
  Soft limits from the controller into the motorRecord:
       setDoubleParam(pC_->motorHighLimitRO_, fValueHighRaw);
       setDoubleParam(pC_->motorLowLimitRO_, fValueLowRaw);
       Note that invalid combinations are ignored.
  Soft limits from the motorRecord into the controller:
      In the axis class: overload the setHighLimit() and setLowLimit()
      methods. Make sure to handle the combination of
      high == low == 0.0, it means "disable soft limits"
