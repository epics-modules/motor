<DIV align="left">
  <P>
  <U><B>Stale SET position data from OMS VME58 controllers.</B></U>
  </P>
  <p>
  A problem with certain OMS VME58 firmware versions (2.24-8S and all 2.35 
  versions) has arisen since modifications made under R6-3.  When the user sets 
  the motor record's position, the previous target and readback positions are read 
  from the controller on the next update.  This occurs with the previous release (R6-3) 
  because the "stale data delay" was changed from 10ms to zero for the drvOms58 
  driver.
  </P>
  <P>
  With this release the driver searches all VME58 board ID's for either 2.24-8S or 
  any 2.35 version.  If any board is found with these versions, the "stale data 
  delay" is set to a non-zero value for all VME58 boards in the system.
  </p>
  <P>
  <U><B>"tdir=" error messages</B></U>
  </P>
  <p>
  A problem was reported by Emma Shepherd (Diamond) with the previous release if 
  the "Use RDBL Link" field (URIP) was set to "Yes".  The NTM logic was sending 
  stop commands and issuing the "tdir=.." message to the console if the RDBL link 
  was used.  This error was the result of changes to the NTM logic in R6-3.
  </p>
  <p>
  With this release, the NTM logic is restored to using feedback rather than 
  reference positions.  In addition, an "NTM deadband factor" field (NTMF) is 
  added to allow the user to set the NTM deadband as follows;
  </p>
  <p>
  NTM deadband = NTMF * (|BDST| + RDBD)
  </p>
  <p>
  NTMF must be >= 2. If properly configured, the NTM deadband prevents NTM 
  logic from issuing a STOP command at the end of a DC motor move that overshoots 
  its' target position.
  </p>

  <U><B>save/restore of motor positions</B></U>
  </P>
  <P>
  Mark Rivers found and fixed a bug in the motor record that resulted in motor 
  positions not being initialized from save/restore at boot-up if the retry 
  deadband field (RDBD) was not included in a save set.
  </P>
  <P>
  <U><B>motorUtil error message</B></U>
  </P>
  <P>
  A bug was introduced into the shell command "motorUtilInit()" affecting these 
  versions of the motor distribution; R6-2, R6-2-1 and R6-2-2. This bug resulted 
  in the erroneous error message; "motorUtilInit: Prefix %c: has more than 53 
  characters. Exiting"
  </P>
  <P>
  <U><B>DC motor support</B></U>
  </P>
  <P>
  Two changes were made to the motor record to better support DC motors.
  <UL>
    <LI>
      With this release, if retries are disabled (RTRY=0), then all moves are done in 
      absolute mode.  This allows a DC motor user to have the readback values 
      calculated based on either the local encoder (UEIP) or the readback link (URIP), 
      but still have all moves commanded in absolute mode.  Previous releases the of 
      the motor record would use relative moves if either the local or external 
      readbacks were enabled, regardless of the state (enable/disable) of the retries.
    </LI>
    <LI>
      The New Target Monitoring (NTM field) logic is changed to use reference rather 
      than feedback positions. This eliminates unwanted motor record STOP commands at 
      the end of DC motor moves.
    </LI>
  </UL>
  </P>
  <U><B>Examples renamed</B></U>
  </P>
  <P>
  The examples iocNoMPF and iocWithMPF were renamed iocNoAsyn and iocWithAsyn, 
  respectively.

  <P>
  The motor record would lock-up when a user tried to move off an activated limit 
  switch with the OMS VME58 servo motor controller board (i.e., model -8S).  
  Although this problem has been resolved there is a design problem with the OMS

  activated limit switch.  Users are advised to avoid this situation
  </P>

  <U><B>Encoder Resolution (ERES) Polarity</B></U>
  <P>
  Previous releases of the motor record forced the sign of ERES to match the sign

  allows the user to change the sign of ERES rather than reverse encoder wires 
  when the motor and encoder direction are reversed.  <B>Warning!</B> This does 
  not work with controllers that are doing closed-loop control; e.g., DC motors.  
  Reference (D/A) and feedback (encoder) signals must have the same polarity for 
  DC motors or the motor will literally run away.

  The STUP field (Status Update) has been modified due to bug fixes.  The STUP

  <UL>
    <LI>
      Valid values for STUP are OFF(0), ON(1) and BUSY(2).
    </LI>
    <LI>
      A Channel Access (CA) client writes ON(1) to the STUP field which causes the 
      motor record to set STUP to BUSY(2) and request a single controller status 
      update.  After the status is updated the record sets STUP to OFF(0).

    <LI>
      CA clients are restricted to writing ON(1) to STUP only when STUP is OFF(0).
    </LI>

    <LI>

  <U><B>Newport MM3000 Communication</B></U>
  </P>
  <P>
  Communication with the Newport MM3000 motor controller was getting out of 
  synchronization whenever the MM3000 responded with an error message. This 
  problem was resolved by having recv_mess() in drvMM3000.c detect an error 
  message response, print the error message and then, recursively, call itself. 
  This restored communication transmit/receive synchronization.

  <P>
  <U><B>OMS VX2-006 Spurious Interrupts</B></U>
  </P>
  <P>
  Spurious interrupts were occurring with OMS VX2-006 ver 1.04 controller boards. 
  For the sake of throughput, the OMS VME8/44 device driver enables the done (DON_E) 
  and input buffer full (IBF_E) interrupts, but disables the transmit buffer empty 
  (TBE_E).
  </P>
  <P>
  The OMS boards are RORA VME type interrupters.  The "release" register is the 
  status register.  It contains information on the status of the transmit/receive 
  buffer interrupts and the done interrupt.  Since the device driver was not using 
  the transmit buffer empty interrupt, it was polling the status register when 
  sending a command to the controller. With the VX2, if the IRQ became active 
  during a status register read cycle, the IRQ was negated at the end of the cycle 
  and the CPU board generated a spurious interrupt.
  </P>
  <P>
  The VME8/44 models somehow prevented the spurious interrupts from occurring by
  latching the IRQ, if and when, the IRQ became active during a status register
  read.
  </P>
  <P>
  This problem has been fixed by using all of the OMS board interrupts (i.e., 
  enable transmit buffer empty).  The OMS VME8/44/VX2/VS4 design is limited with 
  regard to interrupts by an all or none choice.

  With release R4-7, there was a slight (undocumented) modification made to the 
  way that backlash correction functioned. If a move is in the preferred direction 
  and the backlash speed and acceleration are the same as the slew speed and 
  acceleration, then the backlash move is skipped and the motor moves directly to 
  the target position.
  </P>
  <P>
  Unfortunately, there was a bug in the logic that appeared only when MRES< 0. 
  When MRES < 0, and the backlash speed and acceleration were the same as the slew 
  speed and acceleration, the motor record did the opposite of the requirements; i.e., 
  it did backlash correction when the move was in the preferred direction and did 
  not do backlash correction when the move was not in the preferred direction.
  </P>

  <P>
  <U><B>Newport ESP300 Device Driver Crash</B></U>
  </P>
  <P>
  The Newport ESP300 would randomly crash at boot-up because an internal parameter 
  ("drive_resolution") was not always, under all configurations, initialized. With 
  this release, the "drive_resolution" is set based on the response to the ESP300 
  "SU?" command.
  </P>
  <P>
  In addition, the user is required to set MRES to the resolution of the 
  controller as explained in the distribution document <I>motor</I>/motorApp/NewportSrc/README.
  </P>

  <P>
  <U><B>Update Rate Bug Fix</B></U>
  </P>
  <P>
  There were two timing related bugs with the previous release (R5.1).  First, the 
  update rate was not working properly.  The end result was that the motor task 
  was polling controllers as fast as possible.  Second, there was an error in the 
  motor_task function process_messages() that enforces a time delay between 
  UNDEFINED or IMMEDIATE type commands (e.g., LOAD_POS, SET_ENC_RATIO, etc.) and 
  an INFO type command.  One result of this error was that on OMS VME58 
  controllersan INFO update after a LOAD_POS command would, intermittently, yield 
  the previous position.
  </P>

  <P>
  <U><B>Backlash Correction after Jogging Bug Fix</B></U>
  </P>
  <P>
  Backlash correction after jogging was not working for controllers that do not 
  support multiple position commands on the same command line (e.g., Newport 
  ESP300).  This has been corrected with this release with one caveat; in contrast 
  to the feature described in <I>Backlash Correction Bug Fix</I> above, backlash 
  correction is always done after jogging, regardless of the jog acceleration and 
  speed parameters
  </P>

  <P>
  <U><B>DLY field</B></U>
  </P>
  <P>
  Although there is no explicit statement in the motor record documentation, most 
  user's would expect the "Readback settle time" field (DLY) to update the 
  readback after the delay timeout.  It did not do this. With this release, the 
  readback is updated one time after the timeout.
  </P>
  <P>
  Since a functioning DLY field performs the same function as the drv<driver>ReadbackDelay 
  variables, with the added advantage that the delay can be motor specific, the 
  drv<driver>ReadbackDelay variables have been deleted (except for the MM4000).
  </P>

  <h1><b><u>Motor Record Version 5.1 Release Notice</u></b></h1>
</CENTER>

<b>!WARNING!</b><br>

<div style="text-align: left;">
  This release of the motor record contains major modifications.&nbsp; It has not, 
  yet, undergone rigorous testing.&nbsp; I highly recommend that user's test this 
  release in a safe, non-critical environment before committing themselves to 
  using it with their critical applications.<br>
  <br>
  This is the first R3.14 compatible release of the motor record.&nbsp; All of the 
  device drivers, with the exception of OMS, are operating system independent (OSI).&nbsp; 
  Thanks to Joe Sullivan for his work with the initial port to R3.14.<br>
</div>

<BR><b><U>Requirements</u></B><BR><BR>
EPICS base R3.14.2 or greater.&nbsp; See the "Required Modules" section of

<div align="left">
  <u><b>Redundant DMOV Monitor Postings</b></u><br>
  <br>
  Eliminated redundant DMOV monitor postings.&nbsp; Under certain conditions the 
  motor record would post the state of the DMOV field twice. &nbsp;For example, 
  with previous releases the motor record would post DMOV=0 twice if backlash 
  correction was enabled and the user jogged the motor.<br>
  <br>
  <u><b>OMS VME58 Intermittent Limit Switch Status Error<br>
  <br>
  </b></u>There is a problem with OMS VME58 ver 2.35-8 firmware when used with 
  MVME2700 CPU boards.&nbsp; The problem is that the controller board 
  intermittently, reports that there is no limit switch error when there is an 
  error.&nbsp; This error can occur if the user repeatedly, tries to move in the 
  direction of the limit switch when the limit error condition exits.&nbsp; A 
  delay has been added to work around the problem.<br>

    <b><u>New Features</u></b>
    </p>
    <div align="left">
      <u><b>Motor Synchronized DB Puts</b></u><br>
      <br>
      <i>device directive </i>support has been extended to the PREM and POST fields 
      for OMS devices only.&nbsp; The new device directive supports changing the value 
      of a database variable.&nbsp; The syntax is as follows:<br>
      <blockquote>
	PREM - @PUT(<i>pvname</i>, <i>pv-value</i>, <i>delay in seconds</i>)@<br>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
	POST &nbsp;- @PUT(<i>pvname</i>, <i>pv-value</i>)@<br>
      </blockquote>
      Note that the PREM supports a delay argument, but that POST does not. &nbsp;The <i>Readback 
      settle time field</i> (DLY) should be used to create a time delay after the PV 
      specified in the POST field is written.&nbsp; See the <i>Miscellaneous fields</i> 
      section of motorRecord.html for further information on the INIT, PREM and POST

  Home Velocity<br>
  </b></u><br>
  A home velocity field (HVEL) was added with this release. &nbsp;Like all speed 
  related fields, the HVEL is limited by the maximum (VMAX) and base (VBAS) 
  velocity fields.<u><b></b></u> &nbsp;In addition, if HVEL is not initialized by 
  the user, the motor record sets HVEL to VBAS.<br>

  <b><u>Soft Channel Device Support<br>
  <br>
  </u></b>
</div>
<div align="left">
  A conflict between the requirements specified under <i>Requirements 
  Clarification </i>below and the goal of having the same record level 
  functionality for all device drivers, including Soft Channel device support, was 
  found by Tim Graber.<br>
</div>
<div align="left">
  <br>
</div>
<div align="left">
  A problem occurred with, for example, the SoftMotorEx.db that is distributed 
  with the motor record, when backlash was enabled in the <i>hard motor</i>(a 
  motor configured <u>without</u> Soft Channel device support).&nbsp; The result 
  was that the <i>soft motor</i> (a motor configured <u>with</u> Soft Channel 
  device support) would interpret the hard motor's backlash correction as the 
  motor going in the wrong direction, and stop the "hard" motor from completing 
  the backlash correction.<br>
</div>
<div align="left">
  <br>
</div>
<div align="left">
  With this release, the requirements on how the motor record processes a new 
  target position while the motor is in motion have been modified based on a new 
  field; New Target Monitor (NTM).<br>
</div>
<div align="left">
  <blockquote>
    Case #1: The motor record is given a new position, which is in the opposite 
    direction from the current motor motion. &nbsp;If NTM is <u>yes,</u> the motor 
    is immediately stopped and given a motion command to the new position. &nbsp;If 
    NTM is <u>no</u>, the motor completes the previous move before it is given a 
    motion command to the new position.<br>
  </blockquote>
</div>
<div align="left">
  <blockquote>
    Case #2: The motor record is given a new position, which is in the same 
    direction as the current motor motion, but the new position is closer to the 
    motor's current position than the original target position. &nbsp;If NTM is <u>yes</u>, 
    the motor is stopped after it has gone past the new position; then a command is 
    given to return to the new position. &nbsp;If NTM is <u>no</u>, the motor 
    completes the previous move before it is given a motion command to the new 
    position.<br>
  </blockquote>
</div>
<div align="left">
  <blockquote>
    Case #3: The motor record is given a new position, which is in the same 
    direction as the current motor motion, but the new position is further from the 
    motor's current position than the original position. &nbsp;After the motor 
    reaches the original target position and stops, a command is given to the new 
    target position.&nbsp; This case is <u>independent</u> of NTM.<br>
  </blockquote>
</div>
<div align="left">
  <br>
</div>
<div align="left">
  A Soft Channel device support design limitation was discovered by Tim Mooney.&nbsp; 
  The problem is a result of the modifications made with R4-5 below, where the 
  soft motor synchronizes it's target position (i.e., VAL/DVAL/RVAL) with it's 
  readback position (RBV/DRBV/RRBV). &nbsp;Given an application where there are 
  two or more soft motors driving the system (e.g., slit), when one soft motor is 
  moved, the other soft motor <i>sees</i> it's readback changing and synchronizes 
  it's target position with it's readback position at the end of the move, thereby 
  losing it's target position.<br>
</div>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<div align="left">
  With this release, the LOCK field has been added to allow the user to enable/disable 
  synchronization due to the readback changing.
</div>
</center>
<div align="left">
  <h4><u>Backlash Correction Bug Fixes</u></h4> The following scenario would put 
  the motor record into an invalid state. &nbsp;A new target position (i.e., VAL/DVAL/RVAL) 
  is written to the motor record under the following conditions;<br>
  <ol>
    <li>
      motion is in progress (i.e., DMOV is false).
    </li>
    <li>
      the new target position is different from the actual position by less than the 
      retry deadband (|DIFF| &lt; RDBD).
    </li>
    <li>
      backlash correction is enabled (i.e., BDST is non-zero) and the new move is <b>not</b> 
      in the "preferred direction" (preferred direction is the direction in which the 
      motor moves during the backlash-takeout part of a motor move).
    </li>
  </ol>
  A bug was introduced in R4.5 when backlash correction was changed.&nbsp; The 
  error occurred when a new target position was issued while the motor was moving.&nbsp; 
  The motor would move to the new target position at the backlash velocity rather 
  than the slew velocity.<br>
  <br>
  Thanks to Kevin M. Peterson, James B. Stevens and John Maclean for their help in 
  finding and fixing these bugs. <br>

  <h4><u>Newport ESP300 device support</u></h4> Device support for the Newport 
  ESP300 motor controller is available with this release.<br>
  <h1></h1>
</div>

<CENTER>
  <h1><b><u>Motor Record Version 4.5 Release Notice</u></b></h1>
</center>
<b>!WARNING!</b><br>
motorRecord.dbd has been modified.&nbsp; This requires you to 'rebuild' any and 
all user trees (i.e., &lt;ioctop&gt;) that load the motor record (see README 
item #2 for details).
<center>
  <h4><u>Modifications to Existing Features</u></h4>
</center>
<b><u>Communication Retries</u></b>
<p>
Once a communication error is detected, one retry is attempted (Further retries 
are made, if the position RETRY field is non-zero).&nbsp; If the retry fails, 
then a communication error is reported.&nbsp; No further attempt is made to 
communicate with the controller until subsequent user input (e.g., a new target 
position is entered).&nbsp; This change affects all device drivers using GPIB or 
RS232 serial communication mechanisms (i.e., non-VME Bus boards).
</p>
<h4></h4> <h4></h4> <h4><u>Requirements Clarification</u></h4> The requirements 
on how the motor record processes a new target position while the motor is in 
motion have never been specified.&nbsp; The requirements are as follows:<br>
<blockquote>
  Case #1: &nbsp;The motor record is given a new position, which is in the 
  opposite direction from the current motor motion.&nbsp; The motor is immediately 
  stopped and given a motion command to the new position.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  Case #2: &nbsp;The motor record is given a new position, which is in the same 
  direction as the current motor motion, but the new position is closer to the 
  motor's current position than the original target position.&nbsp; The motor is 
  stopped after it has gone past the new position; then a command is given to 
  return to the new position.<br>
  <br>
  Case #3: &nbsp;The motor record is given a new position, which is in the same 
  direction as the current motor motion, but the new position is further from the 
  motor's current position than the original position. &nbsp;After the motor 
  reaches the original target position and stops, a command is given to the new 
  target position (Previous motor record versions ignored the new target position.)
</blockquote>

<h4><u>Bug Fix for Driver Power Monitoring error</u></h4> The <i>Driver Power 
Monitoring</i> feature (available only with OMS VME58 controllers) was 
erroneously and randomly being enabled.&nbsp; This resulted in the error message <i>Drive 
power failure at VME58 card# motor# </i>appearing at the VxWorks console.
<p>
<b><u>Soft Channel device support modifications</u></b>
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Prevent record processing before "interruptAccept" is true.&nbsp; This helps 
    prevent alarms.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the readback is changing, but motion was not initiated by this record, then 
    reset the motor record's target to actual position (i.e., VAL/DVAL/RVAL = RBV/DRBV/RRBV) 
    after the move.
  </li>
  <li>
    Lowered the priority of the "soft_motor task below the "dbCaLink"task.&nbsp; 
    This fixes the "DMOV processing before the last DRBV update" problem.<br>
  </li>

</ul>
<b><u>Bug Fix for Array Holes in VMEbus based controllers</u></b>
<p>
For VMEbus based motor controllers only (i.e., OMS), a <i>hole</i> in an array 
of VME based motor controller boards caused the system to crash with a memory <i>access 
error</i> on the address of the missing controller.&nbsp; For example, if 
oms58Setup(3, 8, 0x4000, 190, 5, 10) was issued without a board at 0xFFFF5000, a 
bus error would occur if the user attempted to move a motor on the missing board.
</p>

<p>
This release allows <i>holes </i>in an array of VMEbus based motor controllers.
</p>

<p>
<b><u>RES Field</u></b>
</p>

<p>
With previous releases of the motor record, the RES field was set to either ERES 
or MRES, based on whether or not the following statement was  true; MSTA 
indicates an encoder is present, AND, UEIP is set to YES.&nbsp;  This state (i.e., 
MSTA indicates an encoder is present, AND, UEIP is set to YES) resulted in the 
record converting all position and velocity related values from EGU's to raw 
encoder counts before sending them to the motor controller.&nbsp; This is the 
manner in which the OMS controllers work (see OMS User's Manual, ER# command).
</p>

<p>
With this release, all raw positions, velocity and acceleration are in terms of 
motor steps. &nbsp;The RES field is preserved for backward compatibility only. &nbsp;With 
this release, the RES field is always equal to MRES. <br>
</p>

<h4><u>Backlash Correction</u></h4> Previous motor record releases put both the 
"slew" and backlash correction moves on the same motor controller command line.&nbsp; 
Some controllers (i.e., OMS) handled this correctly by processing the slew move 
followed by the backlash correction move.&nbsp; Other controllers (i.e, Newport) 
did not handle this correctly and processed the commands immediately, resulting 
in the controller moving to the target position without backlash correction, but 
at the backlash correction velocity.<br>
<br>
With this release, backlash correction commands are not issued to the controller 
until after the slew move is completed.<br>

<h4><u>Separa</u><b>te +/- Limit Switch status bits</b></h4> The MSTA field has 
been modified by providing separate +/- limit switch status bits. &nbsp;The MSTA 
bits  are defined as follows:
<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>
      DIRECTION: (0:Negative, 1:Positive)
    </li>
    <li>
      DONE: motion is complete.
    </li>
    <li>
      PLUS_LS: plus limit switch has been hit.
    </li>
    <li>
      HOMELS: state of the home limit switch.
    </li>
    <li>
      Unused
    </li>
    <li>
      POSITION: closed-loop position control is enabled.
    </li>
    <li>
      Unused
    </li>
    <li>
      HOME: if at home position.
    </li>
    <li>
      PRESENT: encoder is present.
    </li>
    <li>
      PROBLEM: driver stopped polling.
    </li>
    <li>
      MOVING: non-zero velocity present.
    </li>
    <li>
      GAIN_SUPPORT: motor supports closed-loop position control.
    </li>
    <li>
      COMM_ERR: Controller communication error.
    </li>
    <li>
      MINUS_LS: minus limit switch has been hit.<br>
    </li>

  </ol>

<p>
<b><u>Advanced Control Systems and Mclennan device driver support</u></b>
</p>

<p>
Mark Rivers has added device driver support for the following motor  controllers:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Advanced Control Systems, Corp. model MCB-4B
  </li>
  <li>
    Mclennan model PM304
  </li>

</ul>

<center>
  <h1><b><u>Motor Record Version 4.4 Release Notice</u></b></h1>
</center>

<center>
  <h4><u>Modifications to Existing Features</u></h4>
</center>
<b><u>Disable Travel Limits</u></b>
<p>
The travel limits can be disabled by setting both dial high and low limits equal 
to zero; i.e., DHLM = DLLM = 0.
</p>

<p>
<b><u>RVAL ignored error</u></b>
</p>

<p>
A problem was discovered with entering target positions through RVAL.&nbsp; If 
the difference between the current and the next target position (i.e., RDIF, 
DIFF) was less than the retry deadband (RDBD), and the next target position was 
in the "preferred direction", then the new RVAL was ignored.&nbsp; This error 
occured on releases as far back as V3.4.
</p>

<center>
  <b><u>New Features</u></b>
</center>
<b><u>Jog velocity and acceleration parameters</u></b>
<p>
Two new fields (JVEL and JAR) were added to&nbsp; support jog velocity and 
acceleration parameters.&nbsp; These fields are only supported with Oregon Micro 
Systems, Inc device driver support.&nbsp; The JVEL field allows the user to 
change the jog velocity of the motor on-the-fly.
</p>

<center>
  <h1><b><u>Motor Record Version 4.3 Release Notice</u></b></h1>
</center>
This release of the motor record is strictly a bug fix release; no new features 
have been added.
<p>
<b><u>STOP field hangs record</u></b>
</p>

<p>
An error was introduced into the motor record with the release of V4.2 (see 
README file item #14 under V4.2 ).&nbsp; This error occurred if the STOP field 
was activated when the motor was not moving (i.e., MIP = 0).&nbsp; The motor 
record would become "stuck", and not respond to a move request (due to the 
internal state machine associated with IP being set to the "stop" state), until 
the condition was cleared by either a SPMG-stop or some other user action that 
forced the MIP field to zero.
</p>

<p>
<b><u>HIDEOS support removed</u></b>
</p>

<p>
HIDEOS is no longer supported.&nbsp; MPF is the only supported alternative to 
HIDEOS. <br>
&nbsp;
</p>

<center>
  <h1><b><u>Motor Record Version 4.2 Release Notice</u></b></h1>
</center>
This release of the motor record is compatible with EPICS R3.13.2 and above.

<p>
<b>!WARNING!</b> <br>
motorRecord.dbd has been modified.&nbsp; This requires you to 'rebuild' any and 
all user trees (i.e., &lt;ioctop&gt;) that load the motor record (see README 
item #20 for details). <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;
</p>

<center>
  <h4><u>Modifications to Existing Features</u></h4>
</center>
<b><u>Precedence between field pairs</u></b>
<p>
At boot-up, if one field of a field pair (i.e., VMAX/SMAX, VBAS/SBAS, VELO/S, 
BVEL/SBAK) is zero and the other field is nonzero, the nonzero field takes 
precedence.&nbsp; If both fields of a given field pair are nonzero, the RPS 
member of the field pair (i.e., SMAX, SBAS, S, SBAK) takes precedence.&nbsp; 
This requirement was lost with the release of V4.0.
</p>

<p>
<b><u>Moving Off a Limit Switch with a Oms58 device</u></b>
</p>

<p>
An error occurs with the OMS VME58 when the user runs the motor into a limit 
switch and then attempts to move away from the limit switch.&nbsp; If either an 
absolute or incremental move is utilized to move away from the limit switch, the 
OMS VME58 ignores the 1st move attempt.&nbsp; Subsequent moves work.&nbsp; In 
addition, the user can jog off a limit switch.&nbsp; This error was hidden in 
most applications if RTRY was nonzero.
</p>

<p>
<b><u>Separate motion commands for target and backlash moves</u></b>
</p>

<p>
The record level support assumed that the motor controller would accept two 
motion commands on the same command line.&nbsp; This occurs when backlash 
compensation is enabled.&nbsp; Since the IM483[PL/SM] controller does not have 
this capability, support for a command line "record separator" character was 
added.&nbsp; The record separator is defined as an ASCII (IS2) character = /x1E.&nbsp; 
Currently, only one record separator is allowed in a command line.
</p>

<p>
<b><u>Errors introduced in V4.0</u></b>
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, several errors were introduced into the motor record  with V4.0.&nbsp; 
The following have been fixed:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    If the "ncards" argument of the omsSetup() function in st.cmd file was not 
    accurate (i.e., did not match the actual number of OMS VME8/44 boards in the VME 
    crate); the "dbior" command could result in erroneous information or a bus error.
  </li>
  <li>
    Jog request would not work after the state of the UEIP field was changd.
  </li>
  <li>
    Backlash correction was not occurring after a JOG.
  </li>
  <li>
    The motor record would 'hang' in the moving state on the rare occasion when a 
    target position (i.e., VAL or DVAL) fell almost exactly half way between two 
    integer RVAL values, and the retry feature was enabled (i.e., RTRY is nonzero)
  </li>

</ul>

<center>
  <h4><b><u>New Features</u></b></h4>
</center>
<b><u>Newport PM500 device support</u></b>
<p>
Device driver support for the Newport PM500 is available for this release of the 
motor record.&nbsp; This device/driver is based on Mark River's  PM500 V2.0 
release.
</p>

<p>
<b><u>Intelligent Motion Systems, Inc. IM483 device support</u></b>
</p>

<p>
Device driver support for Intelligent Motion Systems (IMS) IM483[I/IE] is 
available with this release.&nbsp; Two different device/drivers are available 
for the same motor&nbsp; controller.&nbsp; The two device/drivers, IM483PL and 
IM483SM, correspond to the two available IM483 communication modes, <i>party 
line </i>and <i>single mode</i>, respectively (see the IMS Software Reference 
Manual for details). <br>
&nbsp;
</p>

<center>
  <h1><u>Motor Record Version 4.1 Release Notice</u></h1>
</center>
Although the motor record software in this release is compatible with EPICS 
baseR3.13.1.1 and above, the directory structure, the "make" files and the 
configuration files are intended for the "unbundled" architecture of EPICS R3.13.2 
and above.
<center>
  <h4><u>Modifications to Existing Features</u></h4>
</center>

<h4><b><u>OMS VME58 retry problem</u></b></h4> Several errors in the OMS VME58 
driver were found.&nbsp; All the errors caused the same problem.&nbsp; Namely, 
erroneous retries occurred intermittently when multiple axes were commanded to 
move on the same controller.&nbsp; This error occurred because old position data 
was being passed back from the driver after Done was detected.&nbsp; The 
erroneous intermittent retries occurred more often when the Oms setup parameters 
called for a high frequency (e.g., 60 Hz) "polling" rate and OMS board 
interrupts were enabled. <h4><b><u>OMS Stop problem</u></b></h4> A problem with 
issuing a stop command (via either the STOP or SPMG field) was found with <b>all</b> 
OMS boards and <b>all </b>versions of the OMS device drivers.&nbsp; The root 
cause of this problem is a statement in the OMS manual <i>that is not entirely 
correct</i>; the AC and VL commands are not completely queued. <br>

  <h1><u>Motor Record Version 4.0 Release Notice</u></h1>
</center>
Release 4.0 of the motor record is <u>only</u> compatible with EPICS baseR3.13.1.1 
and above.&nbsp; This document describes changes made to the motor record and 
its' associated device driver support between versions 3.5 and 4.0.

<center>
  <h4><u>Modifications to Existing Features</u></h4>
</center>

<h4><b><u>GAIN Field Removed</u></b></h4> Since the GAIN field is redundant (i.e., 
PID parameters can be set individually) it has been removed. <br>
&nbsp; <h4><b><u>HOM[F/R] Bug Fix</u></b></h4> Previous releases of the motor 
record had a potential problem associated with the homing function.&nbsp; The 
motorx_all.adl V1.9 MEDM display sets the HOM[F/R] fields on and off, 
corresponding to the user pressing and releasing the respective home button.&nbsp; 
Depending on the <i>pollRate</i> defined in the st.cmd <i>Setup</i> command and 
the speed at which the user toggled the HOM[F/R] buttons; the record level 
software would turn off the DMOV field when the HOM[F/R] button was turned off 
and a motor status update had not yet been received.&nbsp; As a result, when the 
motor completed it's homing function the command positions (i.e., VAL, DVAL, 
RVAL) were not updated.

<p>
All previous motor record releases contained the DMOV problem; the commanded 
position update problem was limited to the previous release (V3.5).&nbsp; With 
this release, a dbPutField to either HOMF or HOMR is valid on a FALSE to TRUE 
transition (i.e., 0 to 1), but a TRUE to FALSE transition (i.e., 1 to 0) will 
result in an error.&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>motorx_all.adl_V2.2</i> (which is included 
with this distribution) sets the HOM[F/R] fields on when the user presses the 
homing button, but is does <b>not</b> set it off when the button is released.&nbsp; 
The motor record clears the HOM[F/R] field when the homing operation is done (i.e., 
completed or terminated). <br>
&nbsp;
</p>

<h4><u>Initial Position</u></h4> If both the auto restore and controller target 
position values are non-zero at boot-up, then DVAL will be initialized from the 
controller's value.&nbsp; In other words, the controller's target position takes 
precedence over the autorestore value when both systems have non-zero DVAL 
values.&nbsp; As before, it is assumed that a zero target position from 
autorestore or the controller at boot-up are default values, and hence, they are 
ignored in favor of a non-zero value.
<p>
Previous releases of the motor record allowed the auto restore to take 
precedence over the controller when initializing the target position (i.e., DVAL).
<br>
&nbsp;
</p>

<h4><u>Access Security Level</u></h4> In order to support the new VMAX/SMAX 
fields, the Access Security Level for the following fields have been changed 
from one to zero:
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>
      MRES
    </li>
    <li>
      UREV
    </li>
    <li>
      VBAS
    </li>
    <li>
      SBAS
    </li>

  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h4><u>MM4000/5 Device Driver</u></h4> Although the previous motor record 
release (V3.5) had device driver support for the MM4000, it is <b>not</b> 
recommended for use with either the MM4000 or the MM4005 controllers.&nbsp; The 
following changes were made to the previous release to create, what is now, the 
MM4000/5 device driver support:

<ol>
  <li>
    The MM4000 device driver software supports both the MM4000 and MM4005 
    controllers.&nbsp; Driver level software detects and saves which controller it 
    is communicating with at boot-up.&nbsp; Currently, there are two functional 
    differences&nbsp; between the two models.
  </li>

  <ol>
    <li>
      The MM4005's position cannot be set by a host.&nbsp; This mean that, for the 
      MM4005 only, setting the motor record RVAL or DVAL fields has no effect.
    </li>
    <li>
      Since the MM4005's position cannot be set by EPICS, the initial position of its' 
      motors (see <i>Initial Position </i>above) will always be initialized from the 
      controller's value.
    </li>

  </ol>
  <li>
    The MM4005 supports up to eight axes.&nbsp; User access to the controller's 
    front panel is required to scroll the front panel display through all eight axes.&nbsp; 
    Since <i>remote mode</i> locks out the user from using the controller's front 
    panel, the motor record no longer puts the MM4000/5 in <i>remote mode</i> .&nbsp; 
    EPICS is unable to communicate with the MM4000/5 controller if it is in <i>local</i>
    <i>mode</i> and the front panel is not at the top menu.&nbsp;&nbsp; A <i>Controller 
    communication error</i> bit was allocated in the MSTA field to help aid user's 
    in diagnosing a controller communication error.&nbsp; Currently, only the MM4000/5 
    device driver sets this error indicator.&nbsp; When the communication error bit 
    is set True in the MSTA, the motor record SEVR field is set to INVALID_ALARM and 
    the STAT field is set to COMM_ALARM.&nbsp; User's who want their MM4000/5 in 
    remote mode at boot-up can add the remote mode command ("MR") to&nbsp; their 
    INIT field.
  </li>

</ol>

<h4><u>Bug Fix for OMS VME58 running on PowerPC</u></h4> Through an odd set of 
circumstances the Oms58 driver was not performing status updates on PowerPC (PPC) 
platforms.&nbsp; All users of the OMS VME58 controller on a PPC platform must 
upgrade to Motor Record version 4.0 for full functionality.
<center>
  <h4><u>New Features</u></h4>
</center>
<b><u>Newport MM3000 Device Support</u></b>
<p>
Device driver support for the MM3000 exist for this release of the motor record.&nbsp; 
Note the following differences between the MM4000 and MM3000 device drivers:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    The MM3000 does not support a generic <i>Load Position </i>commands.&nbsp; In 
    other words, the user can only define the current controller position as being 
    the zero position.&nbsp; This limitation is reflected in the motor record device 
    support.&nbsp; When the SET field is true, the only valid entry to either the 
    DVAL or RVAL fields is zero.
  </li>
  <li>
    The only position units the MM3000 will communicate with the host in, are either 
    encoder ticks or stepper motor steps.
  </li>

</ul>

<h4><u>Uninitialized Oms/Oms58 Driver Error Check</u></h4> With previous release, 
if the Oms or Oms58 driver was some how omitted from the database, a "... card 
does not exist" error message would result.&nbsp; With this release, an explicit 
error check and corresponding error message (i.e., "Oms[58] driver uninitialized. 
") is issued at record initialization if a required driver is not initialized. (Because 
of the particulars of MM[3000/4000] initialization, this is not an issue with 
Newport controllers.) <h4><u>Maximum Velocity Fields (VMAX/SMAX)</u></h4> 
Maximum velocity fields have been added; VMAX in EGU/s units and SMAX in RPS 
units.
<p>
In order to support BURT, range checking is done in such a way that any minimum 
(i.e., VBAS/SBAS) or maximum (i.e., VMAX/SMAX) value entered  is valid.&nbsp; 
For example, if the minimum is entered and it exceeds the  maximum, then the 
maximum is set to the new minimum value.&nbsp; Slew (VELO/S)  and backup 
velocity (BVEL/SBAK) fields are forced by the motor record to be within the 
range set by VMAX/SMAX and VBAS/SBAS, inclusively.&nbsp; For example, if VELO is 
entered and it is less than the minimum, then VELO is set to VBAS.
</p>

<p>
To facilitate software upgrades, a zero VMAX disables maximum velocity error 
checking.&nbsp; Those who use both BURT and VMAX (i.e., nonzero VMAX) should 
insure that VMAX and VBAS are placed before VELO and BVEL in their BURT <i>request 
files.&nbsp; </i>VMAX/SMAX have Access Security Level zero.
</p>

<p>
<i>motorx_setup_1.7.adl</i> (which is included with this distribution) includes 
support for the maximum velocity fields. <br>
&nbsp;
</p>

<center>
  <h1><u>Motor Record Version 3.5 Release Notice</u></h1>
</center>
Release 3.5 of the motor record is only compatible with EPICS baseR3.13.1.1 and 
above.&nbsp; This document describes changes made to the motor record and its' 
associated device driver support between versions 3.4 and 3.5.&nbsp; Those 
changes are as follows:
<center>
  <h4><u>Modifications to Existing Features</u></h4>
</center>

<h4><u>Command Primitives</u></h4> <b>This feature is available only with OMS 
VME8/44/58 or Newport MM4000 device support (i.e., devOms, devOms58, devMM4000)</b>. 
Three motor record fields are available to the user to send ASCII command 
primitives to the servo control board at fixed, predefined, times.&nbsp; Each of 
the following fields is defined as a character string:
<blockquote>
  &nbsp; 1. INIT - Sent at record initialization. <br>
  &nbsp; 2. PREM - Sent before every command string that causes motion. <br>
  &nbsp; 3. POST - Sent after a complete motion is finished <b>or when an 
  overtravel limit switch is detected</b>.
</blockquote>
No error checking is done by the motor record or the device driver to insure 
that the command strings are valid.&nbsp; Command primitives that result in a 
response from the motion control board are valid, but the response is not 
processed. <h4><u>Servo related Fields</u></h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    The GAIN field "prompt" has been changed from "Response Gain" to "Combined Gain".&nbsp; 
    In addition, valid values for the GAIN field have been changed to [0.0, for 
    MM4000 - 0.00005, for OMS] &lt;= GAIN &lt;= 1.&nbsp; For more on PID, see "PID 
    Gain Parameters" below.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <i>status enable </i>field (i.e., STEN) has been eliminated; the <i>control 
    enable </i>field (i.e., CNEN) is used to both control the torque enable and show 
    its' status.
  </li>

</ul>

<h4><u>Unused Fields Removed</u></h4> The following unused motor record fields 
were deleted: MODE, TRAK, MDEL, ADEL, CVEL, POSM, ALST, MLST <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;
<center>
  <h4><u>New Features</u></h4>
</center>

<h4><u>Device Directives</u></h4> Device directive definition and processing:
<ul>
  <li>
    Valid only in the INIT field.
  </li>
  <li>
    Must be identified by the following;
  </li>

  <blockquote>
    <li>
      First character of INIT string must be a '@'.
    </li>
    <li>
      One or more characters followed by a terminating '@'; i.e., device directives 
      must have nonzero length.
    </li>
    <li>
      A valid device directive; currently, only "DPM_ON".
    </li>
  </blockquote>
  <li>
    INIT strings are stripped of valid device directives (including @'s) and tested 
    for nonzero length before being sent to the controller.&nbsp; For example, given 
    the INIT string, "@DPM_ON@HE", the device directive @DPM_ON@ is stripped out 
    before HE is sent to the controller.
  </li>

</ul>

<h4><u>Driver Power Monitoring</u></h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    This feature is only available with the OMS VME58 device support.
  </li>
  <li>
    The 8 User I/O signals are assigned to the 8 possible VME58 axes as follows:
  </li>

</ul>

<ul>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  User I/O #0 &lt;&gt; X axis <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
   "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; " 1 &lt;&gt; Y&nbsp; " <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  ..................... <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
   "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; " 7 &lt;&gt; S&nbsp; "
  <li>
    Drive-power monitoring defaults to disabled at boot-up.&nbsp; Request enabling 
    drive-power monitoring by entering the device directive "@DPM_ON@" command into 
    the motor record initialization field (i.e., INIT).&nbsp; The INIT field is 
    processed at record initialization (i.e., bootup), hence if there are no errors, 
    drive-power monitoring will be enabled after the next bootup.
  </li>
  <li>
    Whenever a request is made to enable drive-power status monitoring, an error 
    check is made (using the VME58 "RB" command) to verify that the User I/O has 
    been configured as an input.&nbsp; The following message will appear in the 
    error log if a configuration error is detected; "Invalid VME58 configuration; RB 
    = 0x####", where "####" is the VME58's response to the RB command.
  </li>
  <li>
    When drive-power status monitoring is enabled and a power failure is detected, 
    the device driver will respond by activating the the RA_OVERTRAVEL bit in the 
    MSTA.&nbsp; This results in either HLS or LLS being activated depending on the 
    DIR field. In addition, the following message will appear in the error log; "Drive 
    power failure at VME58 card#?? motor#??".
  </li>

</ul>

<h4><u>Soft Channel Device Support</u></h4> The immediate goals for soft channel 
motor record device support were twofold.&nbsp; First, to solve the problem of 
nonlinear position conversion in the data base, rather than in the record.&nbsp; 
Second, to provide a more flexible motor record interface for Table Records and 
SPEC.
<p>
New fields have been added to the motor record to support the Soft Channel 
device driver.&nbsp;&nbsp; The new fields are all database links associated with 
existing motor record fields.&nbsp; The new links and their associated fields 
are listed in the table below: <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;
</p>

<center>
  <table border="1" nosave="">
    <tbody>
    <tr align="center" nosave="">
      <td nosave=""><u>Link</u></td>
      <td><u>Link Type</u></td>
      <td>&nbsp;<u>Associated Field</u></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>OUT*</td>
      <td>DBOUTPUT</td>
      <td>
	<center>
	  DVAL

      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr align="center" nosave="">

      <td>DBINPUT</td>
      <td>
	<center>
	  RMP
	</center>
      </td>
    </tr>

    </tbody>
  </table>
</center>

<center>
  <p>
  * - Not a new field, but a new function provided only by soft channel device 
  support.
  </p>
</center>

<p>
The Soft Channel database links are only processed when the Soft Channel device 
driver is selected.&nbsp; These links are ignored when using any other Motor 
Record device driver.&nbsp; At this time, the above links are <b>not</b> 
dynamically retargetable.
</p>

<p>
The OUT, DINP and RDBL are monitored for value changes via a CA event task.&nbsp; 
Users must choose either a dial input link (RDBL) or a raw input link (RINP), 
but not both. <br>
&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;
</p>

<h4><u>Newport MM4000 Device Support</u></h4> This is <a href="http://cars1.uchicago.edu/software/dev_mm4000.html">Mark 
Rivers MM4000</a> device support ported to the latest motor record release.&nbsp; 
The following are the functional differences between Mark's version 1.01 and<br>
this release:
<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>
      When either user or dial travel limit values are entered, a validity check is 
      made using the travel limit values from the MM4000 control.&nbsp; User and dial 
      travel limit values are valid if they are within the travel limits set on the 
      front panel of the MM4000 controller.&nbsp; Attempting to enter a travel limit 
      outside the MM4000 controller's range results in the travel limit being reset to 
      the MM4000's value.
    </li>
    <li>
      Servo support has been extended to the MM4000 controller.
    </li>

  </ol>
</blockquote>

<h4><u>PID Gain Parameters</u></h4> With this release there are two ways to set 
the motor controllers' PID parameters; either through the <i>Combined Gain </i>field 
(i.e., GAIN) or through the individual PID gain parameter fields (i.e., PCOF, 
ICOF, DCOF).&nbsp; Let the motor controller PID parameters be represented by CKP, 
CKI and CKD; then the relationship between these two methods is as follows:
<blockquote>
  <u>For the MM4000</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>For all OMS 
  controllers</u>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>
    CKP&nbsp; = GAIN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    CKP =&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1999.9 * GAIN
  </li>
  <li>
    CKI&nbsp;&nbsp; = 2 * GAIN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    CKI =&nbsp; 2 * 1999.9 * GAIN
  </li>
  <li>
    CKD = 3 * GAIN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    CKD = 3 * 1999.9 * GAIN
  </li>

</ul>
Note that setting any of the individual PID record fields is <b>not</b>reflected 
in the value of the GAIN field. <h4><u>Highland V544 Device Support</u></h4> 
Device support for the Highland V544 is available with this release.&nbsp; This 
version (i.e., version 1.3) is functionally the same as the earlier release (i.e., 
version 1.2).&nbsp; No new features have been added. <br>
&nbsp;
<center>
  <h1><u>Motor Record Version 3.4 Release Notice</u></h1>
</center>
This document describes changes made to the motor record and its' associated 
device driver support between versions 3.3 and 3.4.&nbsp; Those changes are as 
follows: <h3><u><font size="+0">Device driver design error fix</font></u></h3> A 
design error was discovered in the OMS device drivers (drvOms and drvOms58).&nbsp; 
The EPICS device driver support task (i.e., tmotor) would query the OMS motion 
controller for status information immediately after a motion command.&nbsp; 
Since the state of the controller board was in the midst of changing, this 
sometimes resulted in inconsistent or conflicting status information being 
returned to the motor record.&nbsp; This problem was remedied by enforcing a 
minimum time delay (16.67 ms) between a motion command and a status query.

<p>
It is difficult to enumerate the symptoms associated with this problem.&nbsp; 
Sometimes they exhibited themselves intermittently, other times bad data stayed 
in the record.&nbsp;&nbsp; Several symptoms are as follows:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Erroneous motor stops being issued by the device support when changing motor 
      direction.
    </li>
    <li>
      Backlash occurring when the motor is moving in the same direction as the sign of 
      BDST.
    </li>
    <li>
      DVAL and RBV becoming out-of-synch.&nbsp; RBV would always be an old value from 
      the previous move.
    </li>

  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h3><u><font size="+0">PID Parameter Support for VME58</font></u></h3> The motor 
record classifies a motor as a servo if it has two features; an adjustable 
closed loop position response gain and the ability to enable/disable closed loop 
position control (i.e., motor torque).&nbsp; A motor lacking either of the above 
two features is classified as a stepper and is supported by the standard motor 
record features.&nbsp; The following three motor record fields support servo 
motors:
<p>
&nbsp; 1. GAIN - Closed loop position response gain of the motor. <br>
&nbsp; 2. CNEN - Enable/disable closed loop position control request. <br>
&nbsp; 3. STEN - Closed loop position control status (i.e., <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; enabled/disabled).
</p>

<p>
Currently, servo support is only available with OMS's VME58 device support (i.e., 
VME58-[4S/8S/2S2/2S6/4S4/6S2] model boards).&nbsp; At driver initialization, the 
driver automatically detects whether or not the underlying device supports the 
use of the GAIN field and thereby classifies the motor as a stepper or a servo.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Bit#11 of the MSTA field is set on/off based on the results of this test.&nbsp; 
If the device supports the GAIN field, then bit#11 of the MSTA is set on and all 
of the above servo fields are enabled.&nbsp;&nbsp; Otherwise, they are disabled 
and bit#11 of the MSTA is set off.&nbsp; When the servo fields are disabled, 
they can still be read or written to without an error response.
</p>

<p>
The VME58 device support allows the closed loop position gain of the motor to be 
set directly through the GAIN field.&nbsp; For the VME58, setting the GAIN field 
value results in the Combined Coefficient command (i.e., KK#) being executed 
with the GAIN field value as the argument to the command.&nbsp; This command, in 
turn, sets the PID loop parameter values (with the OMS VME58, gain changes do 
not take effect until the command velocity is zero).
</p>

<p>
The user can request that the closed loop position control be enabled or 
disabled by setting the CNEN field nonzero or zero, respectively. <br>
Likewise, the user can monitor the state of closed loop position control (i.e., 
enabled/disabled) by reading the STEN field.&nbsp; See the OMS "VME58 Family 
User's Manual" for further details.
</p>

<h3><u><font size="+0">Command primitives feature</font></u></h3> Three motor 
record fields are available to the user that can be used to send ASCII command 
primitives to the servo control board at fixed, predefined, times.&nbsp; Each 
field is defined as a character string.

<p>
&nbsp; 1. INIT - Sent at record initialization. <br>
&nbsp; 2. PREM - Sent before every command string that causes motion. <br>
&nbsp; 3. POST - Sent after a complete motion is finished.
</p>

<p>
No error checking is done by the motor record or the device driver to insure 
that the command strings are valid.&nbsp; Command primitives that result in a 
response from the motion control board are valid, but the response is not 
processed. <br>
