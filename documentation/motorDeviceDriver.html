    Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    This document describes the device and driver support for the EPICS motors. It briefly
    describes the older APIs for such support (referred to as Model 1 and Model 2),
    but focuses mainly on the newer Model 3 API, which is the API which should be used
    for new motor drivers.</p>
  <p>
    The APIs described here are mainly intended to be used with the EPICS motor record.
    However the Model 2 and Model 3 drivers are actually independent of the motor record.
    They implement standard EPICS asyn interfaces, and can in principle be used with
    any EPICS records, and do not require the motor record. However, the motor record
    currently provides the only "state machine" logic that keeps track of backlash,
    enforcing soft limits, etc. Model 2 and 3 drivers to permit access to controller-specific
    features that the motor record does not support, and this is typicaly implemented
    using standard EPICS records (ao, ai, bo, bi, etc.)</p>
  <h2 id="Model1" style="text-align: left">
    Model 1 device and driver support</h2>
  <p>
    Model 1 is the API that was used for all motor drivers prior to 2006, when Model
    2 was introduced. Model 1 drivers have the following characteristics:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Each controller type requires both device-dependent device support and device-dependent
      driver support.</li>
    <li>The communication channel between device support and driver is custom for the
      motor record, and is very limited.</li>
    <li>The communication between device support and the driver is assumed to be via device-dependent
      strings. Thus, it not suited to register-based controllers, or controllers where
      the driver calls a vendor-library, rather than just sending strings to the controller.</li>
    <li>Cannot use other records to with the driver, only the motor record. Cannot take
      advantage of controller-specific features not supported by the motor record.</li>
    <li>There is no provision for multi-axis coordination.</li>
    <li>There is only a single thread per controller <i>type</i>. This means that if a
      system has, for example, many controllers of a given type then there is only one
      polling thread for all of these controllers. This is because the poller must wait
      for each response before sending the next query. This can lead to significantly
      poorer performance compared to the Model 2 and Model 3 drivers, which have a separate
      thread per controller.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Because this API was the only one supported prior to 2006, the majority of existing
    motor drivers are written using this Model 1 API.</p>
  <h2 id="Model2" style="text-align: left">
    Model 2 device and driver support</h2>
  <p>
    Because of the recognized deficiencies in the Model 1 API, in 2006 Diamond Light
    Source and APS collaborated in developing a new API, now called Model 2. The Model
    2 API has the following characteristics:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Uses standard asyn interfaces to communicate between device support and driver.</li>
    <li>There is only a single device-independent device support file (devMotorAsyn.c).</li>
    <li>There is a single device-independent driver support file for asyn interfaces (drvMotorAsyn.).</li>
    <li>There is a device-dependent driver file below the asyn one. This driver must implement
      a set of functions that the device-independent driver file calls.</li>
    <li>Can use other records to talk to driver via asyn interfaces. This allows support
      for controller-specific features.
      <ul>
        <li>However, this is not as easy as it should be, because the drivers do not directly
          expose asyn interfaces.</li>
        <li>One must write an asyn interposeInterface driver to support controller-specific
          parameters.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>There is no provision for multi-axis coordination.</li>
    <li>There is one polling thread per controller, which is more efficient than Model
      1.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    There are Model 2 drivers in the motor module for the simulation motor, Newport
    MM4000, Newport XPS, Pro-Dex MAXnet, Attocube ANC150, and Aerotech Ensemble.</p>
  <h2 id="Model3" style="text-align: left">
    Model 3 device and driver support</h2>
  <p>
    In 2011 the Model 3 API was introduced. This API is based in part on the ideas and
    infrastructure that were developed for the areaDetector module. The Model 3 API
    has the following characteristics:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Uses the asynPortDriver C++ class from asyn.</li>
    <li>Uses the same single device-independent device support file (devMotorAsyn.c) as
      Model 2 API.</li>
    <li>Model 3 drivers are written in C++ by implementing the methods from the new asynMotorController
      and asynMotorAxis base classes. </li>
    <li>The base classes take care of much of the work that one needed to write in the
      device-dependent driver in Model 2.</li>
    <li>Can use other records with the driver via asyn interfaces. This allows support
      for controller-specific features. This is now very easy to do, compared to the Model
      2 driver.</li>
    <li>The API includes support for multi-axis coordination.</li>
    <li>There is one polling thread per controller, which is more efficient than Model
      1.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The Model 3 C++ API is based on the concept of two types of objects: a motor controller
    and one or motor motor axes. The controller object supports the functions that apply
    to the entire controller. The controller supports one or more axes. The axis objects
    support the functions for a specific axis. These objects are implemented in the
    device-dependent driver. There is a base class for each of these objects, asynMotorControlller
    and asynMotorAxis.
  </p>
  <p>
    The asynMotorController base class has methods that handle much of the work in writing
    a driver, including implementing the asyn interfaces and calling the appropriate
    methods in the axis classes. A basic motor driver derived class will often only
    need to implement only the constructor for the controller class, and can just use
    the base class implementation of all other methods in the asynMotorController class.</p>
  <p>
    The asynMotorAxis base class on the other hand mainly provides dummy methods (asynMotorAxis::move(),
    asynMotorAxis::stop(), etc.). The main work in writing a Model 3 driver consists
    of implementing these methods in the derived class.</p>
  <p>
    There are Model 3 drivers in the motor module for the simulation motor, Hytec XXXX,
    Newport XPS, Parker ACR series controllers (e.g. Aires), and the ACS MCB-4B.</p>
  <p>
    The ACS MCB-4B is the simplest Model 3 driver, consisting of only 336 lines of well-commented
    C++ code (ACSSrc/MCB4BDriver.h and MCB4BDriver.cpp). It does not implement any controller-specific
    features, it only implements support for standard motor record features. It is a
    very good starting point for writing a new driver with basic motor record support.</p>
  <h3 id="asynMotorController" style="text-align: left">
    asynMotorController base class</h3>
  <p>
    The asynMotorController base class defines the following methods:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>asynMotorController(const char *portName, int numAxes, int numParams, int
      interfaceMask, int interruptMask, int asynFlags, int autoConnect, int priority,
      int stackSize)</code><br />
      This is the constructor for the class. The parameters correspond to the parameters
      in the constructor for the asynPortDriver base class. The parameters are:<ul>
        <li><code>portName</code><br />
          The name of the asynPort for this controller. This port name is used to identify
          the controller in EPICS record links.</li>
        <li><code>numAxes</code><br />
          The number of axes on this controller.</li>
        <li><code>numParams</code><br />
          The number of controller-specific parameters for this controller.&nbsp; If the driver
          only implements the standard motor record parameters then this is set to 0.</li>
        <li><code>interfaceMask</code><br />
          A bit mask for extra asyn interfaces supported by this controller. It is not necessary
          to specify the interfaces that the base class implements, which includes asynOctet,
          asynInt32, asynFloat64, asynFloat64Array, asynDrvUser, and asynGenericPointer. Normally
          set to 0.</li>
        <li><code>interruptMask</code><br />
          A bit mask for extra asyn interfaces supported by this controller that will do callbacks
          to device support. It is not necessary to specify the interfaces that the base class
          implements, which includes asynOctet, asynInt32, asynFloat64, asynFloat64Array,
          and asynGenericPointer. Normally set to 0.</li>
        <li><code>asynFlags</code><br />
          asyn flags to use when creating the asyn port. This is normally (ASYN_CANBLOCK |
          ASYN_MULTIDEVICE). ASYN_CANBLOCK means that the driver is "slow" and asynchonous
          device support must be used. ASYN_MULTIDEVICE means that the device supports more
          than one asyn address, i.e. more than one motor axis.</li>
        <li><code>autoConnect</code><br />
          This is normally set to 1, which means that asynManager will automatically call
          the connect() method in the driver if the controller is not connected.</li>
        <li><code>priority</code><br />
          This is normally set to 0, which means that asynManager will use a default priority
          for the port thread.</li>
        <li><code>stackSize</code><br />
          This is normally set to 0, which means that asynManager will use a default stack
          size for the port thread.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3 id="asynMotorAxis" style="text-align: left">
    asynMotorAxis base class</h3>
  <p>
    The asynMotorAxis base class defines the following methods:</p>
  <ul>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This driver inherits from <a href="areaDetectorDoc.html#ADDriver">ADDriver</a>.
    It implements many of the parameters in <a href="areaDetectorDoxygenHTML/asyn_n_d_array_driver_8h.html">
      asynNDArrayDriver.h</a> and in <a href="areaDetectorDoxygenHTML/_a_d_driver_8h.html">
        ADArrayDriver.h</a>. It also implements a number of parameters that are specific
    to the mar345 detector. The <a href="areaDetectorDoxygenHTML/classmar345.html">mar345
      class documentation</a> describes this class in detail.</p>
  <h2 id="StandardNotes" style="text-align: left">
    Implementation of standard driver parameters</h2>
  <p>
    The following table describes how the mar345 driver implements some of the standard
    driver parameters.
  </p>
  <table border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" style="text-align: left">

        <td>
          Setting this to 1 starts an acquisition sequence. If ADNumImages is greater than
          1 then it acquires multiple frames. For each frame it does the following:
          <ol>
            <li>Erases the detector if mar345EraseMode is "Before expose".</li>
            <li>Opens the shutter if either the mar345 shutter or EPICS shutter controls are enabled.</li>
            <li>Waits for the desired exposure time.</li>
            <li>Closes the shutter if either the mar345 shutter or EPICS shutter controls are
              enabled.</li>
            <li>Scans the detector and saves the file.</li>
            <li>Erases the detector if mar345EraseMode is "After scan".</li>
          </ol>
          If ADAcquire is set to 0 during exposure (step 3 above) then it proceeds immediately
          to step 4, finishes collecting the current frame and stops the acquisition sequence
          if ADNumImages is greater than 1. If mar345Abort is set to 0 then the acquisition
          is terminated as soon as possible without saving the data. Note however that commands
          to the mar345 server to erase, change mode, or scan cannot be aborted, so the driver
          must wait for these commands to complete. </td>
      </tr>

  <p>
    It is useful to use NDPluginROI to define an ROI containing the entire mar345 detector.
    The MaxValue_RBV PV in this ROI can be monitored to make sure that the 16-bit limit
    of 65,535 is not being approached in any pixel.
  </p>
  <h2 id="Driver_parameters" style="text-align: left">
    mar345 specific parameters</h2>

    The mar345 driver implements the following parameters in addition to those in asynNDArrayDriver.h
    and ADDriver.h. Note that to reduce the width of this table the parameter index
    variable names have been split into 2 lines, but these are just a single name, for
    example <code>mar345ScanSize</code>.
