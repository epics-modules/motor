AMCI ANG1
=========

Asyn model 3 driver support for the AMCI ANG1 stepper motor
controller/driver.

Modbus/TCP communication, using Mark Rivers' modbus module

Currently some basic parameters, such as IP address, motor current,
etc., will need to be set up on the controller using AMCI's PC/Win software.
Limits and Home also need to be configured with this software: *
  + Limit -> ANG1 Input 1
  - Limit -> ANG1 Input 2
    Home  -> ANG1 Input 3

ANG1 configuration software is available from AMCI's website:

www.amci.com/product-software.asp

Eventually I would like to implement the "Configuration Mode" options
down in the driver, making the AMCI PC software necessary only for
initial comms (IP) setup.

The ANG1 controller/driver is available with or without an ethernet
port.  A group of controller/drivers can contain up to 6 modules, one of
which needs to have the ethernet option.  A single-channel
implementation would need the module with ethernet.  This software is 
intended to support configurations of multiple groups of 1 to 6 modules.  
Again, each group will need 1 ethernet enabled module (ANG1-E).

* Note:  1.)  At some point I would like to add the capability to set these 
         parameters at boot-time, using the ANG1 "configuration mode".  

         2.)  VBAS can only be set in configuration mode (which is not
	 currently supported) or by using the PC configuration software.
	 To use VBAS, set the desired value for the axis using the AMCI
	 PC configuration interface, then set the VBAS field in the
	 motor record accordingly.  That way this value will be used by 
	 the record to correctly calculate acceleration.
