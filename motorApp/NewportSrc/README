Newport ESP300
==============

Serial communication using the GreensSpring XM Octal I/O.
---------------------------------------------------------

The GreensSpring XM Octal I/O has a 16 pin jumper block for each serial port.
Assume (the manual does not define this) that the jumper pins are numbered
from, top to bottom, and from left to right; i.e.,
    1  2  3  4
    5  6  7  8
    9 10 11 12
   13 14 15 16
   
Then the "Default jumbering ..." depicted in Fig. 2 of the GreensSpring XM
Octal I/O manual is jumpered as follows; 1-5, 2-6, 9-13, 10-14.

The correct jumpering for the ESP300 is; 1-5, 2-6, 9-13, 10-11, 15-16.


Setting the motor resolution (MRES) field.
------------------------------------------

For DC motors, set MRES to the ESP300's response to the SU? command.

If there is no other mechanism (e.g., generic serial record, dumb terminal,
etc.) to communicate to the ESP300, the response to the SU? command can be
determined by following this procedure;

1 - uncomment the "USR_CFLAGS += -DDEBUG" line in the NewportSrc/Makefile.Vx
    file (This selects the diagnostic messages to be compiled).
2 - "cd <motor>/motorApp/NewportSrc; gnumake clean; gnumake"; this re-compiles
    the device drivers with the diagnostic messages selected.
3 - Rebuild your IOC; "cd <IOC>; gnumake".
4 - Add "drvESP300debug = 4" to the IOC's st.cmd file before "iocInit".
5 - Connect to the VxWorks shell and reboot the IOC.

The VxWorks shell output should contain lines like the following;

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Starting iocInit
recv_mess(): message = ""
send_mess(): message = VE?
recv_mess(): message = "ESP300 Version 3.03 04/13/00"
send_mess(): message = ZU
recv_mess(): message = "0H"
send_mess(): message = 01ST
send_mess(): message = 02ST
send_mess(): message = 03ST
send_mess(): message = 01SU?
recv_mess(): message = "0.00005101"
send_mess(): message = 01MD
recv_mess(): message = "1"
send_mess(): message = 01TP
recv_mess(): message = "0.00000"
send_mess(): message = 01PH
recv_mess(): message = "18000000H, 7H"
send_mess(): message = 01MO?
recv_mess(): message = "0"
send_mess(): message = 02SU?
recv_mess(): message = "0.00005101"
send_mess(): message = 02MD
recv_mess(): message = "1"
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Note the response to the SU? commands and set MRES to that value.

6 - Turn off diagnostic messages. Either set drvESP300debug = 0 in the st.cmd
    file (there is a very small amount of CPU overhead associated with leaving
    the diagnostic messages loaded), or go to step #1, and reverse the steps;
    comment out the "USR_CFLAGS += -DDEBUG" line in the NewportSrc/Makefile.Vx,
    etc., etc.,
