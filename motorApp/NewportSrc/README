Newport ESP300
==============

Serial communication using the GreensSpring XM Octal I/O.
---------------------------------------------------------

The GreensSpring XM Octal I/O has a 16 pin jumper block for each serial port.
Assume (the manual does not define this) that the jumper pins are numbered
from, top to bottom, and from left to right; i.e.,
    1  2  3  4
    5  6  7  8
    9 10 11 12
   13 14 15 16
   
Then the "Default jumbering ..." depicted in Fig. 2 of the GreensSpring XM
Octal I/O manual is jumpered as follows; 1-5, 2-6, 9-13, 10-14.

The correct jumpering for the ESP300 is; 1-5, 2-6, 9-13, 10-11, 15-16.


Setting the motor resolution (MRES) field.
------------------------------------------

For DC motors, set MRES to the ESP300's response to the SU? command.

If there is no other mechanism (e.g., generic serial record, dumb terminal,
etc.) to communicate to the ESP300, the response to the SU? command can be
determined by following this procedure;

1 - uncomment the "USR_CFLAGS += -DDEBUG" line in the NewportSrc/Makefile.Vx
    file (This selects the diagnostic messages to be compiled).
2 - "cd <motor>/motorApp/NewportSrc; gnumake clean; gnumake"; this re-compiles
    the device drivers with the diagnostic messages selected.
3 - Rebuild your IOC; "cd <IOC>; gnumake".
4 - Add "drvESP300debug = 4" to the IOC's st.cmd file before "iocInit".
5 - Connect to the VxWorks shell and reboot the IOC.

The VxWorks shell output should contain lines like the following;

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Starting iocInit
recv_mess(): message = ""
send_mess(): message = VE?
recv_mess(): message = "ESP300 Version 3.03 04/13/00"
send_mess(): message = ZU
recv_mess(): message = "0H"
send_mess(): message = 01ST
send_mess(): message = 02ST
send_mess(): message = 03ST
send_mess(): message = 01SU?
recv_mess(): message = "0.00005101"
send_mess(): message = 01MD
recv_mess(): message = "1"
send_mess(): message = 01TP
recv_mess(): message = "0.00000"
send_mess(): message = 01PH
recv_mess(): message = "18000000H, 7H"
send_mess(): message = 01MO?
recv_mess(): message = "0"
send_mess(): message = 02SU?
recv_mess(): message = "0.00005101"
send_mess(): message = 02MD
recv_mess(): message = "1"
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Note the response to the SU? commands and set MRES to that value.

6 - Turn off diagnostic messages. Either set drvESP300debug = 0 in the st.cmd
    file (there is a very small amount of CPU overhead associated with leaving
    the diagnostic messages loaded), or go to step #1, and reverse the steps;
    comment out the "USR_CFLAGS += -DDEBUG" line in the NewportSrc/Makefile.Vx,
    etc., etc.,
    

Newport ESP100
==============

Configuration
-------------

- Unlike the ESP300, the ESP100 must be told what type of motor it is connected
to.  This is done using the "Set Motor Type" command; QM.  "QM" arguments are
as follows:
0 - motor type undefined (default).
1 - DC servo motor.
2 - stepper motor.
3 - commutated stepper motor.
4 - commutated brushless DC servo motor.
After setting the motor type, the value must be saved to non-volatile memory
using the "SM" command.

Example
-------

Setting and saving an ESP100 for use with a DC servo motor driven stage (e.g.,
850G);

        1QM 1<CR>
        SM<CR>


Newport MM4000
==============

The MM4000 controller has an approximately 50ms delay before it responds to a
status query.  Hence, it is impossible to get more that a 20 Hz update rate
from the MM4000; 7 or 8 Hz is attainable.  This 50ms delay exists with both
RS232 and GPIB communication interfaces.


Newport PM500
=============

The PM500 has high and low speed loops. Since the EPICS PM500 device driver
does not set any of the low speed parameters (i.e., LSIZE, LACCEL, LDECEL, LV),
the low speed loop feature may interfere with EPICS setting the slew velocity.
I recommend preventing the PM500 from ever using the low speed velocity loop by
setting the Low Speed Loop Threshold (LSIZE) to the motor record's Retry
Deadband field (RDBD).

The LSIZE can be set from the EPICS motor record by entering the PM500 command
in the record's INIT field.  LSIZE is in units of either um or arc-sec.  For
example, if your RDBD = 0.123 mm, then set the INIT field to "LSIZE 123.0".
