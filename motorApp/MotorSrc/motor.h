 * .06 01-27-06 rls - Added LT_EPICSBASE macro for test EPICS base versions.
 * .07 11-19-08 rls - More extensive bit field tests.
 * .08 00-09-10 rls - GNU preprocessor assertions are deprecated with VxWorks
 *                    6.x.  Added test for CPU macros.

 * .10 08-25-11 rls - Replaced deprecated #cpu preprocessor assertions with
 *                    the defined() operator.
 * .11 06-02-14 rls - Jens Eden's modification to add EPICS_BYTE_ORDER to the
 *                    logic of setting {MSB/LSB}_First.
