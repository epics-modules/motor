DESIGN NOTES
============

- The EPICS driver neither reads nor writes the Ensemble's soft limits.
It is recommended that the Ensemble soft limits be disabled and the
user rely on the EPICS motor record soft limits.

- Since the Ensemble network connection requires period communication
from the host to prevent the Ensemble from closing the network socket,
the Ensemble support based on the old device driver architecture will
be removed after R5-6.  The asyn motor architecture support continuous,
periodic updates; the old architecture does not.
