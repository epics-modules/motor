CONFIGURATION NOTES
===================


- Database definition (*.dbd) requirements.
<App>DBD += devAerotech.dbd

- Startup command file (st.cmd) requirements.
("#"  is used to denote st.cmd comment lines.)
("#!" is used to denote st.cmd command lines.)

Configure an asyn communications port driver for the Ensemble.  This can be
either RS-232 or ethernet. For example,

#!EnsemblePort = "Serial"
#!drvAsynSerialPortConfigure(EnsemblePort,"/tyGS0/Mod0/1",0,0,0)

#!EnsemblePort = "tcp1"
#!drvAsynIPPortConfigure(EnsemblePort,"xx.xx.xx.xx:8000", 0, 0, 0)

See asyn documentation for details.

# Aerotech Ensemble digital servo controller
#     (1) maximum number of controllers in system
#!EnsembleAsynSetup(1)

# The Ensemble driver does not set end of string (EOS).
#!asynOctetSetInputEos(EnsemblePort,0,"\n")
#!asynOctetSetOutputEos(EnsemblePort,0,"\n")

#     (1) Controller number being configured
#     (2) ASYN port name
#     (3) ASYN address (GPIB only)
#     (4) Number of axes this controller supports
#     (5) Time to poll (msec) when an axis is in motion
#     (6) Time to poll (msec) when an axis is idle. 0 for no polling
#!EnsembleAsynConfig(0, EnsemblePort, 0, 1, 100, 1000)

# Asyn-based Motor Record support
#   (1) Asyn port
#   (2) Driver name
#   (3) Controller index
#   (4) Max. number of axes
#!drvAsynMotorConfigure("AeroE1","motorEnsemble",0,1)


DESIGN NOTES
============

- The EPICS driver neither reads nor writes the Ensemble's soft limits.  It is
recommended that the Ensemble soft limits be disabled and the user rely on the
EPICS motor record soft limits.

- Since the Ensemble network connection requires period communication from the
host to prevent the Ensemble from closing the network socket, the Ensemble
support based on the old device driver architecture will be removed after R5-6.
The asyn motor architecture supports continuous, periodic updates; the old
architecture does not.

- This driver assumes that the EOT limit switches have been configured
correctly.  If the PosScaleFactor parameter is positive, then a positive move
is a move in the direction of the CW EOT limit switch and a negative move is a
move in the direction of the CCW EOT limit switch.  If the PosScaleFactor
parameter is negative, then a positive move is a move in the direction of the
CCW EOT limit switch and a negative move is a move in the direction of the CW
EOT limit switch


ENSEMBLE CONFIGURATION NOTES
============================

- In the Controller->Communication->AsciiCmdEnable parameter,
check the following items (everything else is unchecked);

    * RS232 Port 1
    * Ethernet Socket 1
    * Always Send EOS

- Set the "Idle Polling" parameter of the EnsembleAsynConfig() call <=
Controller->Communication->Ethernet->Sockets->InetSock1ActiveTimeSec Parameter.

This will prevent the Ensemble from closing the socket.  In addition, the time
between the call to drvAsynIPPortConfigure() and the call to
EnsembleAsynConfig() in the st.cmd file must be less than the
InetSock1ActiveTimeSec Parameter.  If this is not done a socket timeout will
occur during IOC initialization and prevent EPICS from making a communication
connection.


DRIVER LIMITATIONS
------------------

The driver reads the controllers configuration information only at boot-up
(iocInit). If any of the following Ensemble parameters are changed, EPICS
must be rebooted.

- CfgFbkPosType
- PosScaleFactor
- HomeOffset
- HomeDirection
- LimitLevelMask
